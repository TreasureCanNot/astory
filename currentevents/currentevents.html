      <h2>What's the story?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I don't know if you read the previous story, my incredible chronicle. I am pretty proud of it. Sometimes I made have done some mistakes, innacuracies, or assumptions, but overall I feel like it was accurate. But I am done trying to be accurate, I am going to write a chronicle from my own perspective, a new story.</p>
      <p>So a lot has happened ever since the end of my first chronicle and my "diary" that I am doing right now. Alex is now in canada, Milla works at a graveyard, Sebs has a girlfriend, me and sofe went to french classes, and many more things that I am not going to go over.</p>
      <p id="timeskip">Just know that whenever I refer to a period of time between the last event in my previous chronicle(14/06/2024) and the first event in my diary of sorts(09/03/2025).</p>
      <p>That being said, this diary is going to be a little different. I tried (probably failed) to be purely objective in my previous chronicle, however here I am not going to try, im just going to do and write whatever I want. Secondly, I might try making titles because it's fun. Also, in the chronicle I always talked in the third person, but not here, I will just talk from my</p>

          <br>
          <p>A lot of things have happened, i have decided to pursue farmacy or some sort of chemistry. I kind of wanted to do music but given that my school didn't really teach me anything about music, I thought it was a better idea to do something that I have already done before, chemistry. Also I have less chances of dying of starvation.</p>
          <p>The plan is simple, I applied to several universities in the neatherlands, and if I get accepted to any of them I will go there. But if I don't, I will stay studying in Argentina. Argentina is like my safe guard, if all fails I know I can just study here and it'll be fine, I think. The only bad thing is that in order to keep my safe guard I have to attend to the school the Argentine university tomorrow.</p>
          <p>It's called the Instituto de la universidad del hospital italiano de buenos aires but i'm just going to call it the Italian Hospital. Anyways, in order to actually have a chance at getting accepted in the neatherlands I have to take a test in order to remedy my defficiency in math that I aquired due to me taking Math Applications and Interpretations. During the timeskip I studied, I took the test, I failed, then i studied some more with Mr Zarsky, and I really hope I am ready and I can get a good score on this test.</p>
          <p>Today I moved from Uruguay to Argentina, there is a bunch of stuff I have to do like getting a bus card, getting new shoes because I forgot them in Uruguay, getting proof of vaccination for the Italian Hospital University, and much more while also having to study for the Math test which I have to take this week or else my parents won't let me go to Uruguay this weekend to visit Milla(who is in uruguay for some reason).</p>
          <p>i failed to do many things today, I was toot tired because I couldn't sleep last night at all and also travelling is exhausting. There is a lot to do and I don't even know if it's possible for me to do it. But I believe in myself, I got this. Also I believe it's zarsky's birthday.</p>

          <p><b>Location:</b>My Apartment-Italian Hospital Area-Shopping-The house of my grandmother</p>
          <p><b>Title:</b>Hit the ground falling</p>
          <br>
          <p>I didn't sleep well last night. Today I woke up tired so I drank some coffee in Le Pain Quotidienn with my mother. I also bought a muffin and then we took an Uber to the Italian Hospital. Once I got there, I went to class and everyone was sat down already, I was the only one who had arrived late. It's quite characteristic of me so I don't mind.</p>
          <p>I sit down on one of the few empty seats left, next to this guys called Ramiro and at the back of this other guy called Lorenzo. The teacher talks about his teaching methods and university life for like an hour and then he starts teaching stuff I already know. Except resolucion and sensibilidad, I don't think i've learned those before but they don't seem that hard to understand. Ramiro helped me a little bit to understand.</p>
          <p>Then some lady's come and give everyone their institution cards. I still haven't taken a picture that I need to take in order to have my institution card so that might be a problem to solve later. After that the ladies just explain what they are here to do, I unfortunately don't remember any of their names.</p>
          <p>Then I try to do the empadronamiento but I fail to wait enouph time. So instead I try to go early to the next event. Everyone was too early and we weren't allowed to enter before the specified time so we had to wait a while. Eventually we are let in, and then we wait in a room for a couple of minutes, everything is underground for some reason. But then we enter the auditorium (which is underground for some reason). So they talk a lot, they sing the Argentine National Anthem which I don't know, and the Italian National Anthem which no one knows.</p>
          <p>At this point i'm just really tired, I fell asleep through most of the first speaches. But I was awake during a part where they showed that there were a lot of people from the interior of argentina, and 1 person from Chile, Paraguay, and other south american countries but those are the ones that matter. Maybe someone from peru. There were also 9 brazilians and one United Stadian person. However I don't know who any of these people are, I just know that they exist and I might run into them some day.</p>
          <p>After that we did some activities where we kind of got into groups and explained why we chose our medicinal carriers and they made us right post its and stuff. It was okay, I was the only pharmacist of my group. After it finished, I decided to ask one of my fellow companions how to do the empadronamiento, I kind of already knew how to do it but it was better to have some help and also I need to make friends. Her name was pilar and mika also tagged alone. She is from the interior of argentina but I don't remember from where exactly, she has a cat, she took english classes for a while so she probably knows english, and she is overall really nice, she is taking biochemistry meaning she might be in my class.</p>
          <p>So i did the empadronamiento and I took the photo and stuff, very cool. I aquired a new friend, pilar, and also a new aquaintance, mika. Before leaving Pilar gave me her phone number.</p>
          <p>Then I went to eat something with my mom in a shopping. I also bought several clothes, like a new sweater, new pants, and new shoes. Then I went to my apartment and I immediately slept, I had a dream.</p>
          <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: pink;border: 4px dotted darkred; width: 750px;">
            <h2>Timo vs The Shapeshifter and Something Strange</h2>
            <p>There was an award show where Sebs' entire family was invited, including his newly aquired girlfriend. I was there so I sat down with him and we were having fun. We were in this huge building and the host was anouncing the best people on earth, he jokingly anounced Drake, Mr Beast, Donald Trump, and a penguin, before anouncing the actualy best person which was Kendrick Lamar. Kendrick Lamar and Drake where both sat on the same table arguing about music right next to us, it was real funny.</p>
            <p>But then some woman approaches me and kisses me?! without my consent. And I am proper pissed but she ran away. So I go to another place with sebs mocking me for being kissed, I am in a window and in the distant shore, I see a strange fish crawl out of the ocean. And then I look away to Sebs to discuss the random situation and I look back and I see the fish entering this building.</p>
            <p>I have a bad feeling so me and sebs escape the building by jumping off the window and later heading to a cabin in the woods. We wait there for a while, eating baked beans in a can. But then from a nearby pond, something strange crawls out. Sebs deducts that this thing is chasing me and I should try going really far, like to an island. So I do that.</p>
            <p>I go to this island where I find Ethan and I explain to him the situation. The bartender gives us some clues about an old man that told a similar tale. He died in the 13nth floor of this restaurant that was here in this island for some reason. So we go to the 13 floor and we found a note, a story about a woman and a strange fish that chase a man for all his life until he died, you better not be cursed by them or else.../ I guess I was cursed when I was kissed</p>
            <p>This is bad, I look out the window, something strange crawls out of the sea and into the island. It starts going up the stairs and Ethan aquires an idea. This fish is really slow, we can probably make it go all the way up the lighthouse stairs and quickly go down to save us a bunch of time. So we start doing that, the strange fish is like some sort of ugly fish with arms which it uses to drag itself on land. Its following ethan up the stairs and its all going well until I hear a voice and a lady comes, this lady starts taunting me, saying a bunch of stuff, none of it is important until she says "what if it's only pretending to be so slow" the fish suddenly starts moving faster and faster, Ethan trips and the creature catches up to him. I try to help him so I fend off the woman and kick the fish in the face. "I can grab you physically, it can grab you mentally" the woman says as I fight off illusions of the fish trying to attack me. I fall down the stairs and Ethan blew a hole through the wall and we are outside. We get a boat which we use to get the hell out of there but the fish is chasing us really fast in the water.</p>
            <p>Ethan loses it by using some of his tnt to jump into the top of a building. I call Sebs because I want to set up a lunch meetup with him so that I can lure the fish and the changing woman and fight them with sebs and ethan. We have lunch at a restaurant, I am seeing one corner of the street and sebs is seeing the other, the only way to get us by surprise is from above, Ethan is hiding in the roof.</p>
            <p> Suddenly I see the fish, and the lady comes crashing down in the table. But then time goes back instantly like 6 seconds, I see the lady falling again and then time stops right before she falls. The fish summons water to try to amortiguate the lady's fall, but for some reason this time freeze doesn't work on me. I steal their time device and the fish starts chasing me. I threaten to kill the lady by letting time go but the fish claims tha the doesn't care. I let time goe and the lady dies, the fish is shocked. So then I rewind time. I let the fish save the lady but I kept the time device.</p>
            <p>Apparently, this is a duo of mythic entities that like trolling their prey a lot before killing them. They feed off their fear and they also find it really entretaing to play with their food. The penguin from the beginning was the shapeshifter who was planning on killing the host, but then she saw me and thought I was more interesting. So it turned into the woman that kissed me. Anyways I beat them, and hopefully they'll never bother me again.</p>
          </div>  
          <p>Then I woke up and I went to my grandma's to eat, but I left when my grandfather came. Then my sister called, and I also told sebs about my awesome dream but he didn't really reply. This day was cool but quite unproductive, I hope to sleep better now.</p>
          <p>I also talked to Dani, he basically told me that I have a low math level and that I should be productive before going to sleep, thanks Dani.</p>

          <br>
          <p>I arrived an hour early to class by mistake, but I wasn't the only one to make this mistake. Mika too and others aswell. Mika and I went to buy something to eat. We talked about where we live and other stuff, she is much less talkative than Pili which is a shame cause im not that good at talking.</p>
          <p>After a while people started coming and the class finally started. I learned nothing, except from new types of concentration units for solutions. I spent most of the time talking to this smart geeky kinda guy. He knew that there were more states of matter than the usual 3. And he knows about the unit of temperture measurement rankine. Only smart people tend to know this much about stuff, so I can tell he is quite smart.</p>
          <p>He plays the guitar and his name is fernando. He also knows how to use matrices and stuff like that. I also did a lot of math integration problems. I unfortunately didn't talk to Mika or Pili that much today. After school i studied math and then I went back to my apartment.</p>
          <p>I studied math and then I did the mock exam, I did worse than I expected, better than last time but worse than what I expected. After that I saw a notification that Milla visited Plaza Cafe and fetus? . fetus? is a location with a parking lot, i've never been there but it's like the place where most of the table tube gang once went to skate I think. I think i'll surely be able to visit Milla next weekend.</p>
          <p>Overall the day was quite productive but I am afraid I won't be able to sleep well.</p>

          <p><b>Title:</b>The Laboratory Day</p>
          <br>
          <p>Today I woke up bad, I didn't sleep that good. So I spent 45 minutes trying to wake up completely, and I took the bus at 7.45 which made me arrive 20 minutes late to class. My classmates were doing an activity with ions, and the teacher guiding the activity was a student from a higher grade. The activity that everyone was doing was a group activity, so I scanned the class for potential teammates, my friend Pili was already in a group of 3, however there was this dude way in the back that seemes like a cool guy, so I sat with him and we did the activity together. His name is Ian and we lauphed at how complex it seemed and how nomenclature in english was always the other way around in spanish. For example Hidrochloric Acid mentions hydrogen first, chlorine second, and acid last, meanwhile in spanish its Acido Chlorhidrico which mentions acid first, chlorine second, and hydrogen last.</p>
          <p>Then the teacher mentions something about HCLO which I didn't understand, it turns out that it was just a bad example she had used to make the students understand a concept. Then I practiced a little bit of math, but I was too tired so I always got every problem wrong. Eventually, kids from the other class came, and break started. I went to get some facturas at a nearby panaderia and I came back. We corrected some questions about concentration unit conversions. While this was happening I did some math and the guy next to me played chess.com</p>
          <p>After that we had a second break where Pili and I talked about random stuff. Then we all put on our epic lab coats which I bought yesterday and we went to the lab. In the lab we learned about the differnt types of equipment, I learned all of the equipment names in spanish. Everyone learned how to use a pipette and a scale, i felt good because I already knew so I could help Pili and Ian do it correctly</p>
          <p>I also learned about how to calculate what mass I should use if I know that a salt i hydrated, something that I didn't know before. Additionally I learnt how to fold a piece of paper in a way where I can safely contain any powder. Pili also showed me how to swtich my Uruguayan phone number to my Argentinian phone number in whatsapp.</p>
          <p>After that, I went to the bus station and went home. I did some math, but I was getting all the answers wrong because I was tired. I decided to call Sebs. We had fun talking to each other, he had a great time with his girlfriend in Uruguay, and he has been working hard on his job, he works for my dad to import stuff to England. He is also working on a side project to grow and sell spice plants. He is also going to a dance tomorrow. And finally he is also going to a party tomorrow with sofe, one that I was invited to before sofe knew that I was leaving to Argentina. Sebs and I also talked about mushrooms and how Ethan had done weed and shrooms. Sebs also confirmed a theory I had that Ethan used to like Sofe. We also talked about shoes and how Ethan is one of them. More interestingly, Sebs has apparently not hanged out with Milla for some reason, even thought they are both in Uruguay and both in montevideo, I guess sebs hates fun. We theorised about an ultimate corssover episode, hanging out with Sofe and Milla, it could either be a nightmare or the best thing ever.</p>
          <p> Eventually my mother invited me to a cafe and I decided to go. I ate a Chocolate Ingot and some Chocolate Milk. My mother explained to me that sugar is addictive and going one day without sugar was challenging, I accepted the challenge. Also I decided to keep my Uruguayan phone number, so I might have to tell mili to use my uruguayan number.</p>
          <p>Then I was going back home to my appartment when I got an unexpected phone call from none other than Mono himself. He told me a little bit about his life, I updated him on the fact that I moved to Argentina and I started university and all. I also told him that I did shrooms with Bruno and Ethan and we tried to play minecraft, that happened the day before this diary, the last day of the timeskip.</p>
          <p>Then Mono asked me for some help in chemistry. Mono and I tend to understand things better when we do it together, and since my journey in math was not advancing because of my tiredness, I decided to help mono out. We had a lot of fun and we learned about a new equation that relates pressure to the density of a gas which was really epic. We also figured out how to relate temperture to pressure which was a nightmarish looking equation. Overall we both gained a good understanding about enthalpy, intermolecular forces, and math.</p>
          <p>Then I ate at my grandma's house, I ate some good spinach tarta.</p>
