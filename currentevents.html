      <h2>What's the story?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I don't know if you read the previous story, my incredible chronicle. I am pretty proud of it. Sometimes I made have done some mistakes, innacuracies, or assumptions, but overall I feel like it was accurate. But I am done trying to be accurate, I am going to write a chronicle from my own perspective, a new story.</p>
      <p>So a lot has happened ever since the end of my first chronicle and my "diary" that I am doing right now. Alex is now in canada, Milla works at a graveyard, Sebs has a girlfriend, me and sofe went to french classes, and many more things that I am not going to go over.</p>
      <p id="timeskip">Just know that whenever I refer to a period of time between the last event in my previous chronicle(14/06/2024) and the first event in my diary of sorts(09/03/2025).</p>
      <p>That being said, this diary is going to be a little different. I tried (probably failed) to be purely objective in my previous chronicle, however here I am not going to try, im just going to do and write whatever I want. Secondly, I might try making titles because it's fun. Also, in the chronicle I always talked in the third person, but not here, I will just talk from my</p>

          <p><b>Title:</b>Rouph and Tumble</p>
          <br>
          <p>A lot of things have happened, i have decided to pursue farmacy or some sort of chemistry. I kind of wanted to do music but given that my school didn't really teach me anything about music, I thought it was a better idea to do something that I have already done before, chemistry. Also I have less chances of dying of starvation.</p>
          <p>The plan is simple, I applied to several universities in the neatherlands, and if I get accepted to any of them I will go there. But if I don't, I will stay studying in Argentina. Argentina is like my safe guard, if all fails I know I can just study here and it'll be fine, I think. The only bad thing is that in order to keep my safe guard I have to attend to the school the Argentine university tomorrow.</p>
          <p>It's called the Instituto de la universidad del hospital italiano de buenos aires but i'm just going to call it the Italian Hospital. Anyways, in order to actually have a chance at getting accepted in the neatherlands I have to take a test in order to remedy my defficiency in math that I aquired due to me taking Math Applications and Interpretations. During the timeskip I studied, I took the test, I failed, then i studied some more with Mr Zarsky, and I really hope I am ready and I can get a good score on this test.</p>
          <p>Today I moved from Uruguay to Argentina, there is a bunch of stuff I have to do like getting a bus card, getting new shoes because I forgot them in Uruguay, getting proof of vaccination for the Italian Hospital University, and much more while also having to study for the Math test which I have to take this week or else my parents won't let me go to Uruguay this weekend to visit Milla(who is in uruguay for some reason).</p>
          <p>i failed to do many things today, I was toot tired because I couldn't sleep last night at all and also travelling is exhausting. There is a lot to do and I don't even know if it's possible for me to do it. But I believe in myself, I got this. Also I believe it's zarsky's birthday.</p>

          <p><b>Title:</b>Hit the ground falling</p>
          <br>
          <p>I didn't sleep well last night. Today I woke up tired so I drank some coffee in Le Pain Quotidienn with my mother. I also bought a muffin and then we took an Uber to the Italian Hospital. Once I got there, I went to class and everyone was sat down already, I was the only one who had arrived late. It's quite characteristic of me so I don't mind.</p>
          <p>I sit down on one of the few empty seats left, next to this guys called Ramiro and at the back of this other guy called Lorenzo. The teacher talks about his teaching methods and university life for like an hour and then he starts teaching stuff I already know. Except resolucion and sensibilidad, I don't think i've learned those before but they don't seem that hard to understand. Ramiro helped me a little bit to understand.</p>
          <p>Then some lady's come and give everyone their institution cards. I still haven't taken a picture that I need to take in order to have my institution card so that might be a problem to solve later. After that the ladies just explain what they are here to do, I unfortunately don't remember any of their names.</p>
          <p>Then I try to do the empadronamiento but I fail to wait enouph time. So instead I try to go early to the next event. Everyone was too early and we weren't allowed to enter before the specified time so we had to wait a while. Eventually we are let in, and then we wait in a room for a couple of minutes, everything is underground for some reason. But then we enter the auditorium (which is underground for some reason). So they talk a lot, they sing the Argentine National Anthem which I don't know, and the Italian National Anthem which no one knows.</p>
          <p>At this point i'm just really tired, I fell asleep through most of the first speaches. But I was awake during a part where they showed that there were a lot of people from the interior of argentina, and 1 person from Chile, Paraguay, and other south american countries but those are the ones that matter. Maybe someone from peru. There were also 9 brazilians and one United Stadian person. However I don't know who any of these people are, I just know that they exist and I might run into them some day.</p>
          <p>After that we did some activities where we kind of got into groups and explained why we chose our medicinal carriers and they made us right post its and stuff. It was okay, I was the only pharmacist of my group. After it finished, I decided to ask one of my fellow companions how to do the empadronamiento, I kind of already knew how to do it but it was better to have some help and also I need to make friends. Her name was pilar and mika also tagged alone. She is from the interior of argentina but I don't remember from where exactly, she has a cat, she took english classes for a while so she probably knows english, and she is overall really nice, she is taking biochemistry meaning she might be in my class.</p>
          <p>So i did the empadronamiento and I took the photo and stuff, very cool. I aquired a new friend, pilar, and also a new aquaintance, mika. Before leaving Pilar gave me her phone number.</p>
          <p>Then I went to eat something with my mom in a shopping. I also bought several clothes, like a new sweater, new pants, and new shoes. Then I went to my apartment and I immediately slept, I had a dream.</p>
          <div style="background-color: pink;border: 4px dotted darkred; width: 750px;">
            <h2>Timo vs The Shapeshifter and Something Strange</h2>
            <p>There was an award show where Sebs' entire family was invited, including his newly aquired girlfriend. I was there so I sat down with him and we were having fun. We were in this huge building and the host was anouncing the best people on earth, he jokingly anounced Drake, Mr Beast, Donald Trump, and a penguin, before anouncing the actualy best person which was Kendrick Lamar. Kendrick Lamar and Drake where both sat on the same table arguing about music right next to us, it was real funny.</p>
            <p>But then some woman approaches me and kisses me?! without my consent. And I am proper pissed but she ran away. So I go to another place with sebs mocking me for being kissed, I am in a window and in the distant shore, I see a strange fish crawl out of the ocean. And then I look away to Sebs to discuss the random situation and I look back and I see the fish entering this building.</p>
            <p>I have a bad feeling so me and sebs escape the building by jumping off the window and later heading to a cabin in the woods. We wait there for a while, eating baked beans in a can. But then from a nearby pond, something strange crawls out. Sebs deducts that this thing is chasing me and I should try going really far, like to an island. So I do that.</p>
            <p>I go to this island where I find Ethan and I explain to him the situation. The bartender gives us some clues about an old man that told a similar tale. He died in the 13nth floor of this restaurant that was here in this island for some reason. So we go to the 13 floor and we found a note, a story about a woman and a strange fish that chase a man for all his life until he died, you better not be cursed by them or else.../ I guess I was cursed when I was kissed</p>
            <p>This is bad, I look out the window, something strange crawls out of the sea and into the island. It starts going up the stairs and Ethan aquires an idea. This fish is really slow, we can probably make it go all the way up the lighthouse stairs and quickly go down to save us a bunch of time. So we start doing that, the strange fish is like some sort of ugly fish with arms which it uses to drag itself on land. Its following ethan up the stairs and its all going well until I hear a voice and a lady comes, this lady starts taunting me, saying a bunch of stuff, none of it is important until she says "what if it's only pretending to be so slow" the fish suddenly starts moving faster and faster, Ethan trips and the creature catches up to him. I try to help him so I fend off the woman and kick the fish in the face. "I can grab you physically, it can grab you mentally" the woman says as I fight off illusions of the fish trying to attack me. I fall down the stairs and Ethan blew a hole through the wall and we are outside. We get a boat which we use to get the hell out of there but the fish is chasing us really fast in the water.</p>
            <p>Ethan loses it by using some of his tnt to jump into the top of a building. I call Sebs because I want to set up a lunch meetup with him so that I can lure the fish and the changing woman and fight them with sebs and ethan. We have lunch at a restaurant, I am seeing one corner of the street and sebs is seeing the other, the only way to get us by surprise is from above, Ethan is hiding in the roof.</p>
            <p> Suddenly I see the fish, and the lady comes crashing down in the table. But then time goes back instantly like 6 seconds, I see the lady falling again and then time stops right before she falls. The fish summons water to try to amortiguate the lady's fall, but for some reason this time freeze doesn't work on me. I steal their time device and the fish starts chasing me. I threaten to kill the lady by letting time go but the fish claims tha the doesn't care. I let time goe and the lady dies, the fish is shocked. So then I rewind time. I let the fish save the lady but I kept the time device.</p>
            <p>Apparently, this is a duo of mythic entities that like trolling their prey a lot before killing them. They feed off their fear and they also find it really entretaing to play with their food. The penguin from the beginning was the shapeshifter who was planning on killing the host, but then she saw me and thought I was more interesting. So it turned into the woman that kissed me. Anyways I beat them, and hopefully they'll never bother me again.</p>
          </div>  
          <p>Then I woke up and I went to my grandma's to eat, but I left when my grandfather came. Then my sister called, and I also told sebs about my awesome dream but he didn't really reply. This day was cool but quite unproductive, I hope to sleep better now.</p>
