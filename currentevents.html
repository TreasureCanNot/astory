      <h2>What's the story?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I don't know if you read the previous story, my incredible chronicle. I am pretty proud of it. Sometimes I made have done some mistakes, innacuracies, or assumptions, but overall I feel like it was accurate. But I am done trying to be accurate, I am going to write a chronicle from my own perspective, a new story.</p>
      <p>So a lot has happened ever since the end of my first chronicle and my "diary" that I am doing right now. Alex is now in canada, Milla works at a graveyard, Sebs has a girlfriend, me and sofe went to french classes, and many more things that I am not going to go over.</p>
      <p id="timeskip">Just know that whenever I refer to a period of time between the last event in my previous chronicle(14/06/2024) and the first event in my diary of sorts(09/03/2025).</p>
      <p>That being said, this diary is going to be a little different. I tried (probably failed) to be purely objective in my previous chronicle, however here I am not going to try, im just going to do and write whatever I want. Secondly, I might try making titles because it's fun. Also, in the chronicle I always talked in the third person, but not here, I will just talk from my</p>

          <br>
          <p>A lot of things have happened, i have decided to pursue farmacy or some sort of chemistry. I kind of wanted to do music but given that my school didn't really teach me anything about music, I thought it was a better idea to do something that I have already done before, chemistry. Also I have less chances of dying of starvation.</p>
          <p>The plan is simple, I applied to several universities in the neatherlands, and if I get accepted to any of them I will go there. But if I don't, I will stay studying in Argentina. Argentina is like my safe guard, if all fails I know I can just study here and it'll be fine, I think. The only bad thing is that in order to keep my safe guard I have to attend to the school the Argentine university tomorrow.</p>
          <p>It's called the Instituto de la universidad del hospital italiano de buenos aires but i'm just going to call it the Italian Hospital. Anyways, in order to actually have a chance at getting accepted in the neatherlands I have to take a test in order to remedy my defficiency in math that I aquired due to me taking Math Applications and Interpretations. During the timeskip I studied, I took the test, I failed, then i studied some more with Mr Zarsky, and I really hope I am ready and I can get a good score on this test.</p>
          <p>Today I moved from Uruguay to Argentina, there is a bunch of stuff I have to do like getting a bus card, getting new shoes because I forgot them in Uruguay, getting proof of vaccination for the Italian Hospital University, and much more while also having to study for the Math test which I have to take this week or else my parents won't let me go to Uruguay this weekend to visit Milla(who is in uruguay for some reason).</p>
          <p>i failed to do many things today, I was toot tired because I couldn't sleep last night at all and also travelling is exhausting. There is a lot to do and I don't even know if it's possible for me to do it. But I believe in myself, I got this. Also I believe it's zarsky's birthday.</p>
