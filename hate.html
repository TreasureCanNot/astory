        <!-- NOTE: HELLO DANIEL HELLO DANIEL HELLO DANIEL HELLO DANIEL HELLO DANIEL, I knew you would analyse the files, although would you actually go to this specific file? I guess I am trusting my luck, that you happen to open this specific file. Are you proud of me, look at all of this "code" I wrote and it all works somehow. You are a really cool person, and now I have to award you with some secrets, since you found this. Okay, so the first secret, is that Ethan hates you because of that one time you didn't do anything in the presentation for History, he hates how you acted like you had better things to do. I tried telling him how cool you are but it did not work. He hates how conceited you are, and that is about it. Another secret, actually no, just a comment, in the Camp, you asked that question right?, how deep is your wall? I want to ask you a question, if you see this then send me some sort of message or something, why the hell did you ask them that, oh nevermind, you just told me that it was to see if you could reach it. You are cool Dani, but you are also really strange and weird, you do realise that is a question that a pervert would ask? right? you are smart enouph to make that induction, right? You do realise that it is an incredibly weird and out of place question to ask just about anyone......right?!?!?.  Dani, now I am going to talk to you a lot, this was actually an amazing idea, I am preparing something in the console with javascript so be ready.-->

        <p style="color: rgb(59, 9, 44);"> Martina is hiding something, she has something going on, she didn't go to shcool for an entire week, she even has to leave mid-class sometimes. But be not afeard as I, THE MASTER DETECTIVE, have an awsome theory that explains it all. Martina is a SUPERHERO. Now it might sound ludicrous but think about it. She has to leave spontaneously during class, to fight crime, that explains why she skips classes, she didn't go for an entire week to school because she was fighting the main antagonist and was having trouble. She also skips PE classes a lot which makes sense as being a superhero must be very tiring, she is too tired from saving the country (or even the world maybe). An last but not least, she does not tell anyone why she skips classes, of course to perserve her secret superhero identity. I know right, it all makes sense. I'm so smart. My arguments and evidence are off the charts in accuracy and analysis. This is big brain time.</p>

        <p>I hate experimental science so much, i wish I never have it ever again in my entire life, It's so bad, the teacher is bad, the equipment is bad, everything is bad. Okay I am just really mad, but how could I not be, in the final of experimental science I could have done my experiment with a graduated cylinder and measure the displacement of water to get the volume of gas. But there where not enouph materials in the class, so I decided to be a nice person, which ended up being a mistake, instead of measuring the water displacement, I measured how much a seringe moved(assuming it was going to be pushed by the gas) but the gas was not strong enouph so I could not measure the volume of gas with a seringe, we tried every seringe but none worked. My initial experiment was that I needed to find out the correlation between the rate of a reaction of magnesium strips and hydrochloric acid by using the amount of gas produced in a certain period of time, I was going to connect the flask to an inverted graduated cylinder filled with water so that the gas would push the water and I would be able to see the water displacement and find out how much gas was released. Then I decided to do the same thing but instead of a graduated cylinder I used a seringe, which was going to be pushed by gas, but it didn't work. I had to completely overhaul that experiment and turn it into finding out the rate of reaction, by measuring the weight of the reaction as a whole since the mixture would lose weight in the form of gas, but the weight lost was to little for the balance to measure it. SO I ENDED UP HAVING TO MEASURE THE DAMN TEMPERTURE OF THE REACTION. I Went from measuring water displacement to the temperture. Of course every time I changed the experiment I had to change my set up aswell as my entire introduction for the lab report. I hate experimental science, with an unmeasurable passion.

        <h3>The nanowrimo stories of the class</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Friendship Power School - By Timo:</b>A story about what if the class had SuperPowers, it was kinda like My Hero Acedemia, however this book was written before My Hero Academia even existed. The class trains normally when suddenly an evil entity appears and starts threatening their lives with a powerful gun. The team went to investigate an explosion in the middle of the night caused by the same villain. The team saw just how powerful the villain was. Ioel charged his super attack but then the villain whose name was Trevil decided to leave. The team found people that where hurt, one of them was named Valiteo and had snow powers, she joined the team. The next day the Timo decided he needed to assemble a big team of people capable of forfending Trevil's evil. So he went to find more people, he found Lola, and then went to find another person who was in Argentina called, Gonzalo. That is where it ends because it is not finished.</li>
            <li><b>The Land That Time Forgot - By Ioel :</b> A young boy named Troy Zor-el has super speed powers and invulnerability, and a healing factor(which he forgot to mention at the beginning). he trains in the S.H.I.E.L.D academy to, one day, be a super hero. He is sent on a mission along with the sons of Marvel super heroes in order to stop Runa, and villain whose powers are telekinesis, telepathy, and to quote the book "super smartness" the book is not finished.</li>
            <li><b>The acting dream - Some Sofia (not sofi or sofe)</b>Katy lives in a school and does not get brownie :(. They could not get PE, but that was good for Katy, all of the others liked PE and theiy where mad. She read books and entered imagination station. The bell sounded and he couldn't find her class anywhere until she went to music where amanda was singing so stridently that her ears wanted to commit suicide. Then PE came, oooooof for Katy. Tuesday, all the class was there including Amanda. She hates Amanda. Katy wanted to fricking cut her hair. The teacher was really special, like an Angel. Pauli who is my lector was not capable of comprehending the story any further, sorry.</li>
            <li><b>The Undertaker and I - By Martin:</b> The Undertaker is a villain kililng and hurting innocent people, Sami assembles a team along with luka and timo to defeat the undertaker in a soccer mathc and end all evil. They Win</li>
            <li><b>The Gem Of Life - By Fede: </b>A group of strange beings live in a world called Kalamanuratute. Jaimito peppa pig, Rob, Herb, Leo, and Pepperoni have to fix the gem of life which is the source of life of the planet. But Mr.Nasty also wants the gem. They built a spaceship which was sabotaged by MrNasty, so they crashlanded in the "I need water" dessert. The gang became hungry so they ate pepperoni, after that they went to free restaurant that was there and ate more food and drank water. Then they found a technician that built a second ship for them. They investigated the galaxy for ways to hold the stone without dying but in doing so accidentaly went throught construction sites passing the speed limit, they where aught by the police and sentenced to one year in jail. Everyone hated him there, however they recognised Jaimito and said they would let him free, which caused Leo to do a somersault and a split. The group took a selfi and got out. We switch pov's with mr nasty who wants to revive his son with the powers of the gem. But Gustau (his assistant) messed up the cables. Nasty told Leo that if he went to the "Secure Death Volcanoe" he would win 10000000000000 cents. Jaimito warned Leo that it might be a trap, but listen he did not, he passed the smartness and strength test to get there, and he fucking died. After that the team went to a black hole where they had to pass many tests in order to get through </li>

After that I had an english test which I will have to finnish next day, oof. In the recesses I played ping pong, pretty cool. Then I finished my calculator in computer science. And I finished math in lunch, then in math we learned new things and it was super fun, we made groups and war was created.</li>
            <li><b>05/05/2022</b>Terrible day, it's sunny and I hate sunny, History will be boring and painful, spanish is pushing with homework, and I am really dumb in UP History. I haven't got history and PE yet but I bet it will be terrible. This day is so bad, I can not believe how boring it is.</li>
            <li><b>06/05/2022</b>Quite the average day but below aveage, it was yoga in advisory. Boring</li>
            <li><b>07/05/2022</b>Super fun day, we watched a movie, apperently the Rudy's that was in arocena, wasn't opened yet?!??!?!. That was wierd. But we went to crepas anyway so it was fun. It was an <a href="events.html">event</a> so you can see it in the <a href="events.html">timeline</a></li>

        <b>This is interesting how there is a bias of teachers to students, the bad grades always belong to a very specific type of students. There is arguments between Martina, Marina, and Matias, and Nicole joins out of nowhere saying this happens in every school. Nicole always had good grades. This is incredible interesting, so interesting. Lab science tales of Mati, William worksheets, but Mati failed to finish, then more worksheets the next day, it is immposible. Coyle comes and everyone stops talking, then Coyle asks if anyone has any doubts or concerns, no one talks. Everyone can feel the dramatic irony in the room as Coyle proceeds to seat on her desk and talk about ib orals. I am just really mad that my oral was so bad, like wow, it is so bad, I need to get better at speeches.</b>

        <p>So Everybody is leaving, Milla, Marina, Megan, Martina, wow. That is a lot of people, I understand Milla and Megan have to go back because Megan is in the embassy, and well Milla has her own stuff. Marina has friends there too so she will be fine. Martina is going to Boston all of a sudden?!. Quite Crazy, we are losing a lot of people. I hope we get cool new people in this next chapter</p>

        <p>Mili apparently wasn't the biggest fan of Marina</p>
        <b>Claims</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Physics, Marina pretends that she is better than Mili</p>
            </li>

                <p>Marina betrays Mili in her plans because she was drunk</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Woaaaaaa, dramaaaaaaa. But this is actually really interesting because it tackles the themes of deceit, betrayal, and who could forget the classic appearences vs reality which is also present in the works of Arthur Miller, specifically All my Sons. Epic book by the way.</p>

                <h1>Why are the chapters named like that?</h1>
            </center>
            <b>Quarintines</b
            <p>Named after, the quarintines</p>
            <b>Real High School</b>
            <p>The second quarintine was technically high school already, but it hardly felt like it, everyone could cheat in tests and stuff, but this chapter really did feel like something changed, and thus it felt like highschool</p>
            <b>Weird Era Adventure</b>
            <p>At the beginning of this chapter, strange things happened, like Martina coming back after leaving to study in Boston, and many new students joining. Another strange things was that Timo's anomalies became more noticeable, with various predictions being correct, and his luck being way stranger than usual.</p>
            <b>A Grey Break</b>
            <p>This one was just called "break" before. You may have noticed that I didn't give a name to the break between the quarintines and the real high school, and this also happened for the break of Real High school and Weird Era Adventure. I guess they weren't interesting enouph. Take into account I used to only record interesting events. The grey break was pretty boring but stuff still happened like Megan's car aquisition and some fun discord calls.
            </p>
            <b>Things Are Complicating</b>
            <p>Things are getting complicated, would be the correct name, but I named it this, since things are getting so complicated, I can't even grammar correctly. IB started, so things ARE getting complicated, with a ton of homework, more new students, and more bonding, since harsh situations join people together. Like in the book, "The old man and the sea"</p>
            <b>Strange Interesting Break</b>
            <p>This break also didn't have a name before, it was just called "Break 2". However due to later events, I came to realise that there were some strange events. Like Eitoku and Martina travelling together to Japan. Also Timo, Sebas, and Ethan going to the wanderlust hostel. It was at least strange for me since I don't usually hang out with people during break.</p>
            <b>Impending Sudden Times</b>
            <p>I wanted to capture the feeling that something bad was about to happen, not only because of the IB, were people were starting their IA's and the Extended Essay and finishing the CAS reflections. But also things like Eitoku's fall. The word impending meaning how everything was hanging so close the the edge of collapse, and the word sudden to describe how immediately everything became very serious. Lucas also helped me with the creation of this title.</p>
            <b>Pre-Storm Calmness</b>
            <p>Next year is the senior year, known for being a the easiest or the hardest year depending on how much work you did. For me... and lupi, it's the latter because we didn't do the IA's or extended essays or ToK essays help help help help. For Chiara it's pretty easy because she literally did all her everything. All she has to do is study for exams. Anyways the next semester is going to be hell for me, so I better appreciate this calm before the storm while it lasts.</p>
            <b>In Burning Bridges</b>
            <p>I like this name because it abbreaviates to (IBB) so it's like... the IB. Fede gave me the idea to use the Malaphor "I'll burn those bridges when I get to them". it's a combination of two aphorisms: "Don't burn your bridges" and "I'll cross that bridge when I get to it". Fede described the senior situation as all the students being in the middle of the burning bridges, and now we have to see who crosses it.</p>
            <b>Different Common Break</b>
            <p>Well, it's a pretty normal break, much like always Marina and Valeria come to Uruguay, Eitoku leaves to Japan, and everyone just does what they usually do. However the one difference between this break and any other break is that this is the last break we will ever have, after this, we graduate.</p>
            <b>Beginning are Ends</b>
            <p>It's the beginning of the end.</p>

      <p>Today I was in digital society and we were all talking about what we did in our wonderful vacations. I said my part, my very boring part since I only went to Jose Ignacio and I didn't even really like it. But then Chiara added that she met me along with eitoku and Mati in orientation day and she said it was really fun.</p>
      <p>I am really happy that my presence was enjoyed. I was actually quite nerveous that I was bothering them at that time.</p>

        <h3>Dreams</h3>
        <!--
        <p>Sometime ago I had a dream in which Sofe and Juampi broke up, and then they actually broke up. They seemed like they really loved and liked each other so this was really shocking, like Sofe very often said that she was going to marry him. And I had thought that it was just a small detail of a pointless dream. It's specially weird cause it really did seem like they were perfect for each other. And then I woke up that morning, I checked, and coincidentally Sofe no longer had pictures of Juampi in her social media. How sad.</p>
        <p>But that happened two months ago, today I saw that Diego Mandiola Tsang disappeared from the instagram account of Carla Antonia Rivas. You probably don't know who those people are, don't worry I don't either :p, but they seemed really closem Carla even said in one of her posts "you took my shy and anxious self and painted a world where she could live in" which is an absolutely wonderful and heartwarming sentence to dedicate to someone. But now all of that is gone, I guess the lesson from this is that life is unpredictable, even things that people take as certainties, like who you will end up with, can always change.</p>
        <p> Today is 24/04/2024 and I should probably be asleep so that I am well rested for my physics paper 1 and 3 tomorrow. I have a bad feeling about paper 1, I don't like multiple choice :(</p>-->
    </div>
    <br>
    <!--So for the final entry to the events page Lupi and Alex gave me a 6 and a 7 respectively and that really hurt me a lot because I thought we were close. I was finishing that entry in the airport and I started crying so I went to the bathroom and I just cried of a good 30 minutes. How sad Timo, I don't even know who to talk about this. But yeah, I'm unsure of what happens now. I hope you'll be okay Timo-->
