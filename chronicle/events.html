    <p style="font-family: 'Kaisei Tokumin', serif;">Events forge people, welcome to events.html, the main page, it is the story of the UAS Class of 2024 from my perspective. This page was started around the second quarintine, I was really bored in history class so I started a random website where I just played with some tags that I barely remembered from a website development class taught by none other than Mr Turner.</p>
    <p>I started writing in the hate.html page, because I hated history class. I just wrote random stuff. But eventually I had an idea to write down any interesting events (Instead of doing the history work). At first it was nothing really serious, but it slowly started to become more important to me.</p>
    <p>At first I barely wrote some interesting events and stuff, but as time went on I started taking it more seriously, I started writing down more and more events, I started adding the dates consistently. So that's why you'll notice that the first 4 chapters are really bad and short compared to the rest.</p>
    <p>Anyways, this is divided by chapters, the chapter below is a tutorial example chapter and the text in red is just to explain stuff</p>

    <h2>Everything before</h2>
    <div class="vuhj">
      <p>So many things happened before the quarintines. If you want to read a summary hover over this text.</p>
      <div class="vuh">
        <p>In Nursery, there are some students that arrived and they stayed in the school for a long time, these students are Timo, Mati, Luca, Angie, Dani, San, and Salma. Most of those people remained in UAS from the beginning to the end. I say most because Salma technically left for some time and then came back. And Technically Luca did the same thing.</p>
        <p>In Elementary, the class had Ms Susana, Mr Gustavo, and Ms Nicole as teachers. They also had other teachers but those are the ones I remember the most. Oh Also Sylvia and Cecilia from the classes taught in spanish. Nicole was a very nice teacher that had this cool thing called classroom economy where she gave the students fake money and she had a shop where people could buy prices. She was the last teacher that the UAS Class of 2024 had before they entered middle school. </p>
        <p>During this time, the class often played football and infection tag. I believe some swimmers went to friendships and even SAAC because UAS lacks Swimmers. Timo was really really annoying during this time and he had little to no friends. Also this guy called Laith Mokharti joined and he was kind of crazy. Konstantino Savides also joined and he was really kind. Ioel, Ethan, and Timo became like a trio that would usually talk about undertale all day long.</p>
        <p id="BTTBorigin">In middle school, the classes where definately harder, and new students came like Ayla, Sofia Ugarte, Juan Angeleli, and just so many others. Many new people formed a group called the <a href="groups.html#BTTB">Back to the Bench group</a>. Essentially, this group would always sit in a bench that was across the football field, and they would gossip about anyone that wasn't present. It was quite a toxic group. It originally composed of Fede, Nata, Sofia, Ayla, and like some others. Timo realised that he was really annoying during elementary and he became really shy and incapable of talking to anyone, so he sat alone at lunch, the Back to the Bench group invited him and he joined them.</p>
        <p>They went to this Outdoor Educational Experience (OEE). Basically the school takes the class to a place where they stay to sleep and they do activities and they learn about stuff for 2 nights and 3 days. This OEE was at a place called the "red ranch". The boys' room was so loud at night the Nicolas Bruno (The one that manages the OEE) had to tell the boys to shut up several times. They also had this game where there was a water bottle cap. Whoever had the water bottle cap in its possesion by the end of the day gets punished. You give the cap to someone else if they answer a question with a number. Really fun game. They also shot arrows with bows at targets. On the first day, Martina stated that "El tercer dia es la clave" and I don't remember her reasoning.</p>
        <div class="img si40">

          <p class="itg">Cow at red ranch</p>
        </div>
        <p>Timo ate a raw onion as breakfast in the boys' cabin and no one appreciated the smell. They also played hide an seek where Santino took Timo's military flashlight to find everyone immediately (They were playing at night). They also played a game where students had to carry lit candles through a forest and to the top of a hill where they could use the flame to light up a bonfire, but the teachers had to blow out the flames. It was intense, people employed different strategies. Santino used his Mosquito repelent to create an improvised blowtorch which he used to keep the flame lit and simultaneously attack the teachers. I think it was also Santino who encountered a random person in the forest who wasn't part of the Red Ranch staff or the UAS teachers. Timo and Ayla decided to use Ayla's  sweater to cover the flame and prevent it from being blown out, this  was specially useful while climbing the hill since it was quite windy. Timo and Ayla also rekindled someone's flame while they distracted Ms Serrano. Ayla's flame was blown out but the other students perservered and they lit the bonfire succesfully.</p>
        <p>They told a scary story about dolls that roamed the forest they just walked through. </p>
        <p>They also got to enjoy the pool and they bullied someone by splashing them with water, I don't remember who though. I think it was Marina but I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>They also slept in tents in the final day. But they had been tasked to gather materials for the bonfire beforehand, and they succesfully created a second bonfire. Timo woke up the next day and he rekindled the bonfire with the help of Fede, dried leaves, and San's mosquito repelent.</p>
        <p>Their final activity for all the students to wear a white shirt, dip their hands in paint, and play a free for all tag. They also wrote compliments to each other in a page, it was the nicest thing.</p>
        <p>So back in school, Ms Serrano told Lupi that he needed to buy crayons because they were essential for the class, Lupi never used them. Timo, Ayla, and Sofia Ugarte made a presentation about standing desks, but they never presented it. This was because a french wedding brought covid to Uruguay. Let the chronicle begin</p>

      <h3>What happened</h3>
      <p>Covid 19 came to Uruguay after short time in school. they started online learning, it was a time of adapting and difficulty learning, some people enjoyed it but most didn't.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>So this is a quarintine, meaning that people can cheat on tests. Apart from that, you do work on the computer, and you hang out with your friends through discord calls, so your essentially always in the computer. Some people really liked this and some people didn't really like this. Essentially everyone had a lot of free time to do whatever they want.</p>
      <p>People have math, health, physical education(This one was interesting during quarintine), spanish, english(looking at lord of the flies).</p>
      <b id="webdev">Website Development</b>
      <p>Website Development by Mr Turner, he taught everyone the basics of html and css. I found this pretty useful actually.</p>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord:</strong>Discord was used to play video games a lot During this time people where easily integrated into the group through. It was also the Time where Lupinacci and Dani argued daily over the most non-important topics in existance. As an example, they had a very big debate about dream cheating in his manhunts, and also something about enchanted golden apples. People joined to play minecraft or other games, pretty much everyday.</li>

      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>Not many events since, well, it is a quarintine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="da" style="background-color: rgb(222, 166, 166);">
      <h2 id="qu2">Quarintine 2/ Normal classes (2)</h2>
      <h3>What happened</h3>
      <p>This did not feel like high shcool, but it was. The classes were sometimes normal, sometimes online. But when they were normal they always used masks. It depended on what the government issued out.</p>
      <h3>Microevents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>New discord Serv:</strong> The girls wanted to be part of the discord, everyone except Timo, Dani and Fede opposed the idea. However fede was an admin dictator that added them anyways. By the way, the server had a very innapropiate channel, however they figured out a way to prevent the girls from seeing it. </p>
          <p> The girls being in the discord became normal but then one day fede decided to kick Marina out, in retaliation Marina created a server named Server Without Fede (SWF) which had everyone but Fede, eventually fede got added anyway and the server became the main server, with the old server being abandoned. The server's name was also changed to SWF so now everytime someone new joins they will have to explain the entire story of how the server got that name.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="anevent" id="minecraft">
          <h2>A minecraft server was created</h2>
          <p>So Dani, Lupi, and Timo usually played minecraft pvp basically every day. Then Mati decided to create a server with people. The server was called TheUAS and it has a little bit of lore, you can see the lore by hovering on the text</p>
          <div class="vuhj">
            <b>hover over this text if you want to</b>
            <div class="vuh">
              <p>Bascially, Lupi killed cofely after cofely tried to kill Lupi, so cofely was always trying to get back at Lupi.</p>
              <p>Also cofely planted a lot of berries all over the place. zarcnum paid him 10 diamonds in for some fertilizer, it was basically a deal to make Timo stop puting berries in his layer.</p>
              <p>Onono also made a lot of houses for newcomers</p>
              <p>elcracken started a castle that he never finishe.</p>
              <p>Lucas joined and he created a football field</p>
              <p>Lupi made a secret base far away in a savanna biome</p>
              <p>cofely decided to use the seed of the world to find any near savanna biomes, and then he found lupi's base. He was planning to start a war by killing Lupi's dog "Nutz".</p>
              <p>During the quarintines, the class was learning about the US's neutrality policy and how it refused to interfere during some world war until germany sunk their ship. Dani really liked this idea and he planned on remaining neutral so he decided to implement it into minecraft. Thus zarcnum remained neutral towards cofely's ambitions to start a war.</p>
              <p>cofely didn't appreciate this so he decided that he would put aside his grudge with lupi in order to surprise attack zarcnum and kill him for being neutral. cofely and his friend started preparing for a war.</p>
              <p>The war never happened because the server died.</p>

          <b>Timo's Birthday Celebration</b>
          <p>Timo likes inviting all of his class to his birthday and do something fun. All the class was invited plus constan. Constan is not in the UAS Class of 2024, he used to be during elementary but his mother decided to move him to a boys only christian school. However he is still a good friend of Timo and he has good vibes (buena onda) with Luca, Mati, San, and others who were with him during nursery and elementary. </p>
          <p>They went go karting this time and afterwards they ate pizza and marshmellows. It was really fun. Lupi had such a fun time that he fell asleep. This won't be the latst time that Lupi sleeps in a party. Everyone came excpet Millamaya Makimarti and Kacey Chen.</p>

            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>Timo is bored in History class and doesn't know what to do. He decides to use the <a href="events.html#webdev">Website Development Knowledge</a> that turner gave him to create a website. So he <a href="hate.html">creates a website</a> where he just writes random dumb things, the first things he wrote are the questions "Is there anythign cool in this world" and Martina's Super Hero Theory. Martina has been missing school a lot lately, so Timo creates a theory that is probably true, you can give it a read it's still there.</p>

        <br>
        <li>
          <p>Zarsky at some point decides that he will show the class the movie interstellar to his class since it has a realistic depiction of relativistic phenomena and thus it's educational. Martina really liked it and now she likes astrophysics.</p>

            <h2>Back to the bench is dismantled</h2>
            <p>This group gossiped a lot about everyone who wasn't present. They also had a lot of debates about controversial topics such as abortion and stuff like that. It was a pretty toxic group. But many of it's members left throughout the years. Sofi, Nata, Fede, Milla, Megan, and Timo are the only ones left. Nata and Sofi are leaving, at this point it's no longer really the same group.</p>
            <p id="whymilla">Towards the end of school, once all the finals were over with. The Back to the Bench group did a secret santa. They went to the park in arocena near the club lon tennis. Timo received cactus socks from fede. Fede received a cauldron mug. And Milla decided to wrap her gift in duck tape making it extremely hard to open. This became Milla's signature gift-wrapping style.</p>
            <p>They got McFlury's. Sofi and Timo went to get Crepes while they talked about how the biology final was easier than the biology tests because they are more broad and thus topics need to be studied with les depth.</p>
            <p>Later that day, Sofi taught Fede how to do his nails. Fede came home to his family, and trouble happened. His family didn't like the fact he painted his nails. At this moment Fede realised that he would some day have to come out to his family because otherwise he was going to die inside.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="rudy">On a seperate ocasion, Sofi invites the Back to the Bench to <b>Rudy</b>, a burger place that has amazing burgers. It's menu is very limited but the few burgers that they offer are really good. Rudy is located near Montevideo shopping. It's the only location they have at the moment. Rudy will become a fundamental meeting place for the class.</p>
            <p> So teh Back to the Bench group is summoned one last time to Rudy for Sofi's birthday. And they had fun. They talked about how they all most definately cheated on the Math test even though Mr Zarsky made them take an oath that they woudln't cheat. Fede also got a cactus called Emily. The Back to the Bench has a history with Cacti that have several problems including but not limited to scoliosis, but they love their cacti anyway.</p>
          </div>
          <strong>Og Back to the bench vanishes:</strong>In the last day of school sofi and nata left, leaving only 4 members of BTTB. These for people went on to create a new group.

      </ul>
      <h3>Ending</h3>
      <p>A quite normal ending, not many interesting things happened, but one thing is awsome, and that's what comes next. Vacations came and everyone went to many different places.</p>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>A weird time, no one did practically anything, all world was bad thanks to covid and many world events that caused a lot of chaos(specially in the US). Many girls decided to leave after this, and everything started changing, and what comes next is a completely different era.</p>
      <b>Fare well</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="others.html#marina">Marina Battig</a> who will be going to the US</li>
        <li><a href="others.html#salma">Salma Zeinal</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>Also, before this Dani would never agree with anyone. But his several discussions with Lupi made him realise that he is not always right and sometimes he ahs to look at things from other people's perspectives. That's what he said anyways. Lupi also noticed the phenomenom that Dani started to always agree with him on everything. Dani said that he would take other people's advise into consideration given that they have "An acceptable amount of IQ"</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>
    <p>Now I'll give you a bit of a summary of what just happened. Everything was fine until the quarintines happened. No one actually learned anything in any significant way while the quarintines where happening. People just spent all day playing video games, and that was mostly it.</p>
    <p>In the second quarintine, it wasn't really a quarintine since sometimes they still went to school, but everyone was really strict about masks and other stuff. They always played among-us in the recess and lunch since they had to eat in the classrooms. Also ocasssinaly someone woudl get sick and he/she would connect to the class. He/she would appear in the big smart board screen.</p>
    <p>For the next chapter, most of the effects of the quarintines are gone, they don't have to use masks anymore, the next chapter is the real beginning of all of this, the quarintines where kind of the backstory to all of this.</p>
    <p>(By the way, the timeline started in Real High School, that is why there is so little information of the quarintines.)</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Pre-IB started, class shedule went insane, and most of the girls left, they only have 4 now. they also have 2 new students(Sebastian Sass and Joshua Salisbury) and maybe 1 new girl(EDIT: She never came).<strong>(2/august/2021)-Some day in the future</strong></p>
      <p>There are two types of days, A days and B days. Every student has their own A and B schedule, Mondays and Wednesdays are A days while Tuesdays and Thrusdays are B Days. Fridays used to be all the classes combined, but now they alternate between being A and B days.</p>
      <b>New students</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="others.html#sebas">Sebastian Sass</a> </li>
        <li><a href="others.html#josh">Joshua Salisbury</a> </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <p>So, many girls left our school for this quarter, like <a href="others.html#sofi">Sofi</a> , <a href="others.html#nata">Nata</a>, <a href="others.html#vale">Vale</a>, <a href="others.html#marina">Marina</a>, and <a href="others.html#salma">Salma</a>. So this class is now mainly boys. Also the class is in 10nth grade and the International Baccalaureate (IB) is essentially obligatory in the school of UAS. This means that the classes are now meant to prepare people for the IB. One of this classes is experimental science, a class that only teaches you how to do experiments and how to calculate error. A dats are hell and B days are heaven, everyone agrees that this is the case.</p>
      <p><strong>Early confusion:</strong>At the beginning of the class everyone was confused about getting art credits, they thought that if they didn't get art credits and now they wouldn't be able to get them, so they all left PE and went to art, however it turns out that they didn't need to go to art, but it was too late and the director did not let them change back. Except for Martina who somehow convinced the director to let her change to PE.</p>

            <h2>Table Tube Gang Origin</h2>
            <p>So you may recall the <a href="groups.html#BTTB">Back to the Bench</a> 4 people remain from this group, Megan, Timo, Milla, and Fede. The two new students Sebas and Josh joined these 4 people during lunch.</p>
            <p> Sebas and Timo started talking about random things while playing volleyball and specially badmington, Timo insists on teaching Sebas some volleyball skills throughout RHS. WHile doing this, Timo told Sebas that Marta(Timo's grandmother from his mother's side) taught him a spell that allows him to cure headaches from any distance. Apparently this spell can only be passed down to someone during christmas, and it was passed down to Timo. Timo likes science and thus he doesn't really like the fact that the spell works most of the time but he thoerises it could be placebo effect.</p>

            <p>And Josh was just there, he plays the electric guitar really well, he is christian, and he goes to the gym. He is a pretty unique and cool dude, he doesn't usually talk much though. Usually will just add a witty funny comment on top of conversations.</p>
            <p>One day, this new group was sitting in a blue metal table. The outside cafeteria space has a lot of blue tables, and some blue metal tables have this strange tube in the middle.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The particular table that this group was sitting in had a tube that was only being held to the table by one lonely rusty nail. During this time, the devious lick was a popular trend so I think you know where this is going. Timo proposed they could use nitric acid to dissolve the nail. Josh proposed a more logical appraoch which was to just use a screwdriver. That's what they ended up doing. They officioally stole the Table Tube.</p>
            <p>This was the first significant thing they did together, and so this is called the Table Tube Gang, named after the fact that they stole a tube from a table.</p>

          <p>They ended up eating pizza in a place called El Escondido, which was a sort of hidden place. Fede wasn't sure that Timo was taking him to the right place since Timo is known for always being kind of lost. But this time he was right. After eating pizza, they enjoyed some ice-cream at las delicias</p>

          <p><strong>Garage Burger:</strong>Lupinacci wanted to do something so he asked everyone if they wanted to do something in whatsapp, many people wanted to but no one suggested anything, Nata wanted to do something so she messaged Timo to suggest something together. Timo was in arocena walking when a random girl gave him a pamphlet of a burger place, so he suggested that. Lupinacci and Nata were the only ones to reply. Lupi couldn't go at 20:00 which was the hour everyone agreed on, so they changed it to 20:30, but he never showed up. Constan joined last second. They ate burgers. After that the group went to Nata's house.</p>
          <p>Also, Without her mother's consent or knowledge, Martina died... her hair, of the colour red or burgundy. I don't really know why. Probably because of some anime or something like that. During the quarintines she basically became obsessed with anime which makes sense since there wasn't that much to do during the quarintines.</p>
          <p>It's probably like a one time thing, similar to the time where <a href="others.html#nata">Natasia Bethe</a> dyed part of her hair blue or the time where <a href="others.html#sofi">Sofia Ugarte</a> dyed half of his hair pink</p>

The only ones who were serious about doing something Consta, Nata, and Timo. Nata new about many scary movies but all the hours where to late. In the end, Nata, constan and Timo went to watch, "A quet place 2" very late in the night.</p>
          <p>The movie was pretty good. Essentially the planet was overidden by a biologically perfect species that can't see but can hear very well. However in this movie it's discovered that they can't swim which is pretty cool.</p>

He also asked Timo for Constan's contact so that he could invite him aswell. At the beginning people were eating chips and talking about music, but then Lupinacci and Martina came, Martina brought a volleyball ball so they played volleyball, the ball ended up in the roof multiple times but they always managed to get it back down. When they finished playing, they ate and talked a bit more and then went back to play volleyball but more people joined this time.</p>
          <p>After that the burgers were ready and everyone ate them, Martina and Lupinacci got very tired and they decided they were going to lie down on a sofa with a blanket that Mati provided them with, however Lupi stole most of the blanket and Martina didn't like that. Then they all went for a walk to go to the swings, Martina took the whole blanket for heself as revenge and Lupi wasn't a fan of that, so Lupi started chasing down Martina, and they fought for the blanket on the way to the park. At the park, they enjoyed the swings a little, but they quickly decided to go back.</p>

          <p>The Chemistry class does some interesting chemistry things. Hydrogen Peroxide naturally decomposes to water and oxygen in an exothermic way . However this process takes a long time when it happens naturally, luckily there is a tool that chemists can use to increase the rate of reaction. Catalysts are capable of reducing the activation energy require for a reaction to take place, they make it easier for things to happen. </p>
          <p>So now more molecules are above the threshhold of energy required to react.Water and Oxygen are the products created by this reaction, and they are also gasses. Thus if you add soap and maybe some food colouring to the reaction, the gasses create it will blow many tiny bubbles creating coloured foam! But its an exothermic reaction so be careful not to brun yourself.</p>

          <p><strong>One Last Unexpected Thing!!!</strong></p>
          <p>Before finals start, Martina reveals that she will be leaving the UAS Class of 2024 by the end of this chapter. She is planning to leave to Boston for some reason. Everyone is shocked and they try to convince her to stay but it seems that the decision is made..</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ending</h3>
      <p>The finals end, Timo invited some people to watch spiderman no way home, lupi Fede and Mati came, after that they went to Rudy's. In Rudy's, they look at photos that they took during this chapter and the comment on them, some of them are pretty funny.</p>
      <p> Martina left to boston, and Marina is coming back in the next chapter of the timeline.</p>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>This year was incredibly exciting and scary, the world was still pretty bad, they had to wear masks and stuff like that, but they got used to it and they made the best out of it together. Things where starting to be more normal, this was a better high school experience than quarintines. The change was more cool than scary. And what will happen next, some particularly weird stuff happens. Also, people are leaving.</p>
      <b>Fare well</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="others.html#marti">Martina</a>, going to boston</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also there are people that are coming back, like Marina, and there will probably be new students.</p>

Aswell as Nicole, who already knows many people of the shcool since she was in the school like in third grade, and also Marina, who had been in an exchange program to the US I think or something like that.</li>
        <li><strong>Unbalanced Shedule:</strong> The shedule never got fixed so A days are still hell and B days are super easy</li>
        <li><strong>Weirdness:</strong> Many unexpected things happen, Nicole comes back, Marina comes back, Mili and Chiara get introduced, Bruno is introduced and he is one of the weirdest parts of this chapter.</li>

          </ul>
        <p>These are 2 fundamental members of the Table Tube Gang, so it's really sad that they are leaving.</p>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="mevent">
          <p><strong>Hish School Party:</strong> NHS organised a party to gain money for prom, the part had alcoholic beverages and people brought vape, many attended it. </p>
          
          <p>People danced inside while drinking beer in a group, while Fede, Ethan, Timo, and Lupi talked outside, they then decided to go up where Lupinacci continued his tradition of sleeping at parties. Ethan decided to try drinking beer, and trhough the night, he finished a bottle. </p>
          <p>Mili really wanted some beer but could not open the bottle, so she simply smashed it against the wall, big brain move.</p>

In a strange maneuver, Alex lands terribly and dislocates his shoulder or something. He went to the nurse, asssisted by many, and then he could not take PE for the rest this Weird Era Adventure. Nice one. Instead he took art which he absolutely hated.</p>

          <strong>Timo's Birthday Celebration:</strong> Timo made a groupchat about his birthday, in which he added the entire class except Bruno because he failed to get his phone number and could not talk to him, he also added Nata and Constan. Alex was not able to come because he had a broken arm. San was not in Montevideo. Josh never replied to any messages. And Lucas was very occupied, however, Timo convinced Lucas to come despite having a tight shedule. And then at 21:00 people started arriving. </p>
          <b>The firsts</b>
          <p>Seba came first and tried out the ewheel.</p>
          <p id="ewheel"> The Ewheel is an electric unicycle that can go up to 50km per hour. Sebas tried it out but he failed multiple times. It's fairly hard to learn how to use one since it takes some balance.</p>

          <p> After that Lucas came to the party, Timo introduced them to all the party place, there were sofas, a ping pong table, and a volleyball. </p>
          <p> Timo played Lucas some ping pong and got destroyed since Lucas plays tennis professionaly and he is really good. After that more and more people started arriving. Lupinacci arrived along with Marina and Martina. apparently she arrived to Uruguay that very same morning. She said she was going to come back to UAS, so I guesssss</p>
          <div class="">

          <p>The Table Tube Gang gave Timo some sort of package wrapped completely in duck tape<a href="events.html#whymilla">(similar to this time)</a>. After an eternity, Timo got it oppened, inside there was a UNO hot wheels car, a kinder egg with a barbie ponytail inside, and a paper saying that Timo was now a lord of sealand. The paper was not oficcial but they said the oficcial paper would come to his home eventually. Which at the date I am writing this 27/02/2022, has not arrived yet(EDIT: — 16/03/2022 it arrived I am a lord of sealand feel my power). Nata and Luca got him a chess book for begineers which was useless to him. And Marina, Mili, and Chiara got him money.</p>

          <p>After playing some ping pong with people, and destroying Sebas at chess. Timo decided to go inside where he played super smash bros against Ethan. After that he saw everyone playing football, so he told everyone that there was an actual soccer field they could go to. It took a huge effort, but they finally got everyone moving towards the field, while Timo showed off his ewheel skills (falling down twice). In the field Ethan tried to learn how to ride the ewheel and he kinda got the hang of it. Then Chiara tried it but Ethan accidentally dropped the wheel on her foot, which left her with an injury that hurt for the entire next week. The group saw the disturbing instagram of the new student, Bruno Nario. His instagram had very tabu stuff and racist things?? I personally didn't get to see it but from what I've heard, it's not good. Then they played football penalties while Milla and Megan watched from atop the playground games.</p>
          <p>Milla then tried the ewheels and she was surprisingly good. Lupi tried the ewheel with a broken leg, so he needed to use the things for the broken legs that I don't remember the name of. Then everyone went back to the house to eat ice cream and pizza. At this point they were pretty tired, specially Martina who had a flight today.</p>
          <p>Timo played ping pong with Dani and Constan while everyone else chatted while eating ice-cream. after that many people leave and only Lupi, Luca, Ethan, Angie, Mili, Martina, and Mati. They play super smash bros and exploding kittens. Then Ethan left and they where all on our phones. And finally, everyone else left.  </p>
          <p>Too bad Santino couldn't come. The conclusion is that it was a nice start to everything. </p>

          <p><strong>Fede's Birthday Celebration:</strong>Fede invited the table tube gang to bowling/arcade. Nothing much happened but it was revealed that at the end of the Weird Era, Milla and Megan will leave to their respective countries, Finland and the US. Although Megan wants to stay and is going to try to stay in Uruguay in Alex's house</p>
          <p>Nata realizes she wasn't invited. This was probably because Fede only invited everyone in the Table Tube Gang group, accidentaly excluding Nata who belonged in the older but now mostly disasembled Back to the Bench group. Regardless of the reason, Nata got mad and stopped talking to Fede.</p>
          <p><i>Note</i></p>
          <p>In Nata's next birthday, she made sure to invite everyone but Fede. Even including people like Sebas whom she barely knew at the time.</p>

          <p><strong>Hanging out 06/March/2022:</strong> Lupi wanted to do something so he he told everyone they should hang out. But he did not want to do it at his house so he asked marina to suggest her house.</p>
          <p>Timo, Mili, Angie, Mati, Martina, and Lupi went to Marina's house to hang out. Timo brought tomato and lemon chips at the behest of Mili, and she was actually surprised he got them. They talked in the trampoline. After that Mati played ping pong against Timo, it was a close match, but Timo won, Angie wanted to go to the pool, and so she did, she tried to convince everyone to join her, but no one did.</p>
          <p>Then everyone went inside where Mati and Marina played the most intense and complex game. It was too complex for the average human mind to understand. I think Marina won, or they tied. It was hard to tell</p>

        <li>
          <b>Minecraft</b>
          <p>So Mati created a minecraft server. I will be refering to everyone by their minecraft usernames because its fun. Lupi is Lupinacci so I will still call him Lupi. But I won't tell you the rest :) mostly because this does not impact real life at all.</p>
          <p> The group played minecraft on an smp created by Mati. Lupi was trying to kill everyone in the server and cofely was trying to kill Lupi to stop him from killing everyone. cofely surprise attacked Lupi, and was about to kill him when lupi used an enderpearl to escape, then he proecceeded with his plan to kill Onono. Lupi was about to kill onono, cofely intervenes, however this time Lupi noticed cofely before he was able to surprise attack him, they exchanged hits, the battle is even. Lupi ate cooked mutton to regain his health, cofely responded by eating his signature sweet berries to regain absolutely nothing and he proceeds to get destroyed by Lupi (berries are not the best food source). And thus Lupi killed everyone. After that chaos started happening and DumpyBunda(the owner) reset the server and everyone left.</p>
          <b>Okay but this part is important</b>
          <p>Martina confirmed via discord call that she is coming back. In the same discord call</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Timo cuts his hair</b></li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Minecraft lore</b>The next day Martina wanted to play, but everyone took too much time so she ended up not joining. They played party games, which consists of a series of random games and the one that wins the most games wins the round. cofely dedicated absolutely everything he had to sabotaging Lupi as revenge for killing him last time. However Lupi is cracked at party games, and thus he still managed to get in second and even first once.</p>
        <p>After that they played on Mati's recently reset server. Lupi tried speedrunning and cofely was gaining materials to sabotage him. Lupi avoided cofely using distance so cofely never got to kill him back. After that DumpyBunda decided to enter creative mode and build a house, he also gave creative to Mandariina. While zarcnum helped her and cofely build his own little house beneath the pond that mandariina made. They where talking about jobs and the future. But Mati broke the rules of not using creative, so he reset the server for the last time. </p></li>
        <li class="mevent" id="ohmili">
          <p><b>Mili insisted for Timo to invite eveyone to hang out at his house so when he finally invited everyone only 3 people came and none of them was Mili:</b> So Mili failed to go to Timo's birthday, and thus she insisted for Timo to invite everyone to his house again. This was not ideal because Timo lives very far away from everyone. He lives in a place caled latahona which is like 25 minutes away from school.</p>
          <p>So Timo eventually gave in and invited everyone to have some burgers, but as expected, many people couldn't find a way to get all the way to Timo's house and back so it was moved to the next day.</p>
          <p>In the next day, it almost got canceled again, but thanks to Mati's efforts, Lupi, Marina, and Mati could come. Mili however couldn't come because she had some medical issue. So Mili's absence wasn't completely unjustified however Timo often taunts her about the fact that she made him invite everyone and then she didn't show up.</p>
          <p>They made hamburgers, but one of them fell into the fire.</p>

          </div>
          <p>After that, they try to re-create a funny picture that Lupi's sister had taken. They were quite succesful if you ask me.</p>

          <p>Then they play with Capu and with a Frisbee. Timo accidentally hits Capu with the frisbee twice. After that, they grab a boomerang, but no one really knows how to use it so they proceed to grab a volleyball.</p>
          <p>Eventually they all go inside and play super smash bros with funny looking Miis that they created of themselves. Then they start a game of monopoly but they end it immeidately because everybody thought it was boring.</p>
          <p>Then they eat ice-cream and then they left.</p>    
        </li>
        <br>
        <li id="bullying">
          <b>Mili and volleyball</b>
          <p>So in Physical Education, people play volleyball, thats the sport that is currently being covered. Alex is pretty good at volleyball and he really likes it even though he claims to have never played it. But that's besides the point. The point is that sometimes volleyball gets kind of competitive, but only slightly.</p>
          <p>Several people (like Sebas) don't like actually try in volleyball, and so they just kind of stand in the volleyball court doing nothing. Mili is one of these people. People who don't do anything in court are often taunted by the rest of the team who is actually invested in the game. Sebas didn't really mind this, but Mili absolutely did.</p>
          <p>The person that taunts Mili the most is Lupi and Mili was absolutely not having it. In tonights discord call, Mili was absolutely fuming and she got mad at essentially everyone for making fun of her due to the volleyball situation. She claimed that they had no right to make fun of her and that she didn't give a shit about the Physical Education class. Lupi argued that if she has the right to not give a shit about PE, then everyone has the right to make fun of her since she is ruining the game for those who actually want to play.</p>
          <p>The argument went back and forth for what felt like hours. Fabrizzio ended up muting everyone in the call so that Mili could calculate the percentage of people that made fun of her in PE since she was in Extended Math[The prep course for Math HL]. She came up with the results that either 50% or 11.6890834983% of the people made fun of her (Both are wrong it was actually 100%) Everyone started making a transcript of what Mili was saying in the general chat which was really funny. Essentially no one agreed with Mili and everyone believed that if you are not going to try at volleyball then you should be okay with puting up with some taunts. I also want to clear out that Lupi's taunts are never very serious, they are all joke. Even though they might get really irritating after a while</p>
          <p>After that insanity, Martina confirmed she was coming back to school. The group also played a bit of minecraft, where Mili joined for a second, cofely started living in Mili's house on the basement. And DumpyBunda scammed cofely.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <p>Timo invites Alex to play ping pong in the ping pong tables, Alex plays against him but he is not that good, he is an average level of good. Then Alex goes to sit with the Table Tube Gang. </p>
          <p>This has been were Alex often sat, he kinda joined the Table Tube Gang and became friends with it's members. During History class, he usually plays fireboy and watergirl with sebas. And he has art with Milla, Megan, and Fede even though he would have rathered having Physical Education. Unfortunate how he broke his arm. And now he often plays ping pong with Timo</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Martina did come to school after this day, but it was for like 2 minutes and she didn't take classes so it doesn't count.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>21/03/2022</b>
          <p>Okay now Martina actually took classes and stuff so she is officially back. She's got a lot of catching up to do though.</p>
          <p>Also, almost the entire core maths class got mad at Zarsky because they doubted his teaching methods, later that day in a discord call, Martina, Dani, and Lupi voiced their opinions against Mati, Milagros, and Marina[OoOoo alliteration].</p>
          <p>Mati, Marina, and Mili claimed that Zarsky was not a good teacher. Mili was not in Zarsky's class but she knows her brother hates him and that is enouph evidence for her. Mati and Marina are also not in his class at the moment but they still think Orrico is better.</p>
          <p>Dani argues that Zarsky's teaching methods are great. Martina pointed out that Zarsky clearly wanted his students to learn. And I don't remember what Lupi said. Timo was also here and he agreed with Martina.</p>
          <p>Martina also likes Zarsky because during the second quarintine, Zarsky let the entire class watch Interstellar because of it's realistic depiction of wormholes, black holes, and time dilation aswell as an intuative visual to understand the 4rth dimension. Zarsky is a good teacher</p>

          <p><b>Gender talk in Advisory 25/03/2022:</b> In advisory, the teachers decided that it was a great idea to seperate the group into boys and girls, and talk about gender related topics.</p>
          <p>The boys where with Mr.Zarsky, they talked about very non-interesting stuff actually, they just listed out stereotypes and how they affect men in society. The only coflictive thing that came out of the talk of the boys was how Lupi said that a boy could never be a friend of a girl, but he immediately took it back and rephrased it into a much less conflictive and more understandable take, saying that if a boy and a girl are friends, but one cofesses love, it might ruin their friendship.</p>
          <p>Girls on the other hand, where not afraid of criticising the opposite gender. Ms Coyle asked the following question "Who is the villain of the girls?" the girls agreed that the boys where the villains. I don't really know how many answers that question really had. They said that girls are competitive towards each other thanks to boys putting up expectations and standards that must be met, and thus girls become their own villains, but the boys are behind it all so they are the master villains. Things such as beauty standards. They also mentioned rape, and other things that made boys the true villains towards girls.</p>
          <p>This event caused ripples of conflict throughout the day, where in the breaks they would discuss about the stereotypes and all of that complex stuff. The Table Tube Gang pretty much agreed that this was one of the most effective ways to make the class hate itself. Maybe Zarsky and Coyle wanted to bring awareness or something. The next advisory is going to be the two groups together, discussing what they talked about in this advisory.</p></li>

        <li class="border1" id="thejoke">
          <p><b>THE JOKE:</b> Timo, Alex and Sebas where walking out of computer science. Timo sarcasticly said that Sebas was the best ping pong player in the school, Alex believed it, and Timo and Sebas looked at each other took this opportunity to make him think that Sebas was a ping pong master. Sebas said an amazing quote by the way "They call me the Ping Kong". Timo and Sebas told Lucas to tell Alex that Sebas beat Lucas in a ping pong match. Now Lucas is a proffessional tennis player, the best of his age in Uruguay, and thus he also plays ping pong spectacularly, so beating Lucas is actualy an insane achievements. It was an entire conspiracy. Sebas is actually one of the worst ping pong players in the school, so to prevent Alex from finding out, Timo and Sebas must do everything in his power to prevent Alex from playing against Sebas</p>
          <p>Alex then plays against Timo, and Alex beats him.</p>
          <p>By the end of the day, both Timo and Sebas are completely surprised at how Alex completely fell for it. He believed the entire thing despite how ridiculous it sounded.</p>
          <p>So basically, The Joke is making Alex believe that Sebas is incredible at ping pong even though he is not.</p>

        <li><b>The second advisory talk:</b>The class discussed problems that the girls faced, mainly stereotypes and how girls get paid less in jobs and are not hired as often as boys. The boys mostly agreed that this was a problem. In order to fix this, society must be changed, which isn't the easiest thing to do. It will most likely be a really slow but massive effort. Most people did not enjoy this talk, but Dani really enjoyed arguing.</li>

        <li id="quantumrelativity">
          <b>Relativity</b>
          <p>Timo talks about relativity with the Table Tube Gang, the only ones that actually listen are Ethan and Milla. Basically, gravity is not a force, it's the curvature of space time. The reason the curvature creates an illusion of a force is because Time is going forward. However in curved space time, your forward movement in time gets shifted to a forward movement in space, making you move in space. Timo knows a lot about relativity and quantum physics because during the <a href="events.html#qu1">quarintines</a> he was really bored.</p>

          <b>7/4/2022</b>
          <p>Alex and Timo are going to play ping pong, but the paddles were missing. So Timo and Alex conducted a small investigation to try to find the missing ping pong paddles. They asked around and eventually Timo came to the conclusion that the seniors have taken them, the seniors had computer science in the last class and so Timo and Alex went to the computer lab and searched around, they found the ping pong paddles in a carton box. From here, a joke originated that Alex was Timo's detective even though Alex didn't do anything.</p>

          <p>Also, a long time ago, before high school and before the quarintines, Timo found a red hat with ear flaps that he always carries with himself and he uses to keep his ears warm when its cold.

Nothing that they didn't know, however, the IB talks made several students question their previous decisions about what to take in the ib. In advisory they had a talk about IB subjects, Coyle said that the last day in school would feel amazing but sad, they all felt sad because they knew that someday, they will walk into a class for the last time, and be together in that school for the last time, the class was sadly thoughtful about the future, all of the class kept saying a common spanish metaphor "en el dia de Mañana" which means "in the day of tomorrow". Lucas fiandra interrputed the thought by saying "but tomorrow is saturday"</p>
          <p>By the way "The Day of Tomorrow" is a direct translation from the Spanish saying "El Dia de Mañana" which means "Some day in the future". "Tomorrow" in this case is any day in the future.</p>

But what the teachers didn't know is that the English teachers (Kimberly Coyle and Maritte Mosckovicks) made an agreement with the class in which if everyone in the class chose language and literature, then Kimberly will teach literature and Mosckovick would teach language and when Coyle leaves then Mosckovicks takes over, that way they would have both teachers in the IB.</p>

            <h2>Madness of the Table Tube Gang</h2>
            <b>06-07/05/2022</b>
            <p>The table tube gang + Ethan decided to go watch the Multiverse of Madness the marvel film. But more happened after that. The Movie was really interesting, it was definately watchable. But it wasn't really that good, and it was kinda nonsensical at some moments. I really liked the part where Doctor Strange used the souls of the damned to stop the Scarlet Witch from using America Chavez to kill the Multiverse of Madness.</p>
            <h3>People</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Milla</b></li>
              <li><b>Fede</b></li>
              <li><b>Timo</b></li>
              <li><b>Alex</b></li>
              <li><b>Megan</b></li>
              <li><b>Ethan</b></li>
              <li><b>Josh:</b>Left early</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>story</h3>
            <p>First they went to watch the Multiverse of Madness, the movie was okay, not great, not terrible. After that fede lead the way to arocena, but the gang stoped at a park. In this park the gang played with swings and other things, and then some people decided to climb trees. Josh left the group here.</p>
            <b>Handwhistle lessons</b>
            <p>while on a tree, Timo explained how to hand whistle to Milla and Ethan and they where capable of doing it. The hand whistling cult expands further, Timo's goal is to teach this to as many people as possible. Alex couldn't do it but he will learn eventually. Also Josh left the gang in this park.</p>
            <div class="img" style="width:500px;">
              <img src="img/handwtree.jpg" class="ing">
              <p class="itg">Milla, Megan, and Ethan learning how to handwhistle on a tree</p>
            </div>
            <p>After that the gang kept going to arocena, on the way Timo tried teaching Alex how to handwhistle again but Alex simply could not get the hang of it, then the gang started singing random songs like "gotta get up" or "house of gold" until</p>
            <b style="color:rgb(106, 66, 23);">El Robinson</b>
            <p>Some homeless guy approaches the gang and says hi, he asks if the gang speaks english and the gang responds positively, he asks for money, Milla reaches her pockets for a 100 peso bill and hands it to him while the rest of the group simply had no money, except Seba who had his pocket full of cash, but he did not want to give him money because if he opened his pocket the man would see how many bills he had but Sebas would only give him like 20 pesos and it would have been kinda awkward. The man told his story.</p>
            <div style="border:3px dotted blue; width:600px; padding:10px;">
              <p>The man came from a wealthy family and he studied a lot and became smart, he knew what a diode was, however he did not listen to his parents, who forced him to go to church. He then sold his house to play the guitar in the streets but then became poor and homeless, while the brothers that did listen to their parents had money and fun, he also sang some songs and christian prayers, he said that he worked for stella maris(a church). Through his speach he was smoking a cigarette. He knew many languages like German, english, spanish, chinese, armenian, and probably another one which I do not remember. He told them his name, Robinson, and thanked Milla for the money, they thanked him and continued.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is very likely that none of that was true, but the Gang thanked the man and they continued on their journey.</p>
            <p>The gang was now thoughtful thanks to Robinson (although Ethan is jewish and Robinson said many christian prayers), so the gang discussed theories. Milla's theory was that life is about building up you're energy and dying is just to realease the energy into the world. Timo agreed with this. Ethan discussed the theory of brains forming in supernova's and the universal conciousness. Sebas also talks about how he is afraid of death and the idea of nothingness after death.</p>
            <p> The reason the gang was going to arocena was because Timo remembered there being a <a href="events.html#rudy">Rudy</a> in arocena. Fede doubted Timo about Rudy in arocena, claiming that it was just his ADHD brain working bad. Timo was now beginning to doubt himself, maybe he was just being dellusional and it wasn't really there. But his worries vanished when in fact there was a Rudy in arocena. However its innaguration was tommorrow, so they couldn't eat there. So the Rudy restaurant had apparently not opened yet.</p>
            <b>Crepas</b>
            <p>The group got there just in time before it closed, everyone got something to eat except Sebas who got a smoothie</p>
            <b>The walk</b>
            <p>The gang got up and started walking, they went to la rambla where Alex and Seba noticed Timo was only wearing a T-shirt even though it was 8 degrees celsius. They asked Timo if he was cold but Timo wasn't, they asked how and he responded "homeostasis and breathing" and then Ethan made a demon slayers reference. Timo really likes the cold and really dislikes the heat. He usually only wears a sweater if the air is too damp or it rains.</p>
            <p> The gang then walked down to the beach where the group seperated into 3 groups, there was alex, ethan and timo at the front, fede and sebas at the back, and milla and megan switched between groups. The front group spent sometime trying to help timo with his ib decisions, chem or physics, or computer science... or biology (he is really lost) while the back group creted an awesome poem. Timo also explained breathing to Alex who was getting colder, you have to use your diaphragm (I probably messed up the spelling of that word). The gang walked for a long time until they reached a street that lead to fede's house. The gang went to fede's house and parents came and some took uber's and the table tube gang members returned to their homes.</p>

"Are you going to date in college?" "What do you consider cheating?"" and finally "Where do you see yourself in 4 years". People gave their opinions, for the first some said yes and some said no, the most interesting answer was Daniel's, not because of his answer, but because of the fact that you could physically feel him thinking of every possible scenario for like 15 seconds and the said no. He then explained his calculations, claiming that he was going to work hard and would not have time for a girlfriend. For the second one everyone kinda agreed that doing anything unironically romantic with someone is bad, except Mili who believed that making out with someone to gain something like free tickets to a place is worth it, no one agreed. And for the third question, not many people answered it, but Dani informed the class that he was going to become a software engineer and he has his entire life planned, good for him.</p>

            <p>Basically, Thomas Midgley is a man that created an anti-knocking agent that prevented engines from getting damaged, however the anti-knocking agent (tetraethyllead) had lead. Midgley kind of hid the fact that his compound had lead by siply calling it "Ethyl". Thomas Midlgey didn't care and he sold it, it became the most used antiknocking agent worldwide. Many people started suffering from lead poisoning, and many people have brain problems because of this. He is the reason why older generations have a higher concentration of lead in their bones and teath. Clair Patterson was the scientist that discovered that the extra lead in the enviorment wasn't natural, he did this by looking at the concentration of lead in different sea levels and in glacial samples. Clair campaigned against Midgley with his evidence.</p>
            <p>Despite knowing how dangerous lead was, despite being warned by several health authorities about the dangers of his invention, Midgley persisted with his product and became a billionare. But he didn't stop there</p>
            <b>Part 2: Freon (dichlorodifluoromethane)</b>
            <p>Thomas Midgley was also the one that invented a refrigerant. During the 1920's, most refrigerants where toxic or flammable. Midgley created a chemical compound that was neither flammable or toxic. He created dichlorodifluoromethane, the first chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). This amazing substance was marketed under the name of "Freon". The substance is actually very safe, unfortunately when it goes up into the atmosphere and UV radiation hits it, it creates another substance that can react with the ozone in the ozone layer. This effectively created a hole in the ozone layer</p>
            <b>Quotes about Thomas Midlgey</b>
            <p>Enviormental Historian John Robert McNeill says that Thomas Midley "had [a] more adverse impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history."</p>
            <p>Author Bill Bryson states that Midgley possesed "an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny."</p>
            <p>Science writer Fred Pearce described him as a "one-man enviormental disaster"</p>

        <li><b>24/05/2022:</b>Lupinacci gets a haircut and now he does not want to show his head. Also Lupi and Timo had a ping pong match worthy of remembering, they both played really well. The match was to 11, however there is a rule that states that you have to win by more than 2 points. So the match went up all the way to 21 until Lupi won. The match ended with Lupi smashing the ball and Timo (who was 3 meters away from the table in a defensive position) failing to receive Lupi's attack correctly despite his preparation, and thus Lupi won.</li>

        <li>An advisory where people wrote down philosophical questions and then the class tried answering them. The questions where
          <ul>
            <li>What defines a mindset?-Megan</li>
            <li>Do you believe in fate?-Alex</li>
            <li>Is a utopia possible?-Ethan could not come up with one so Timo gave him his.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I forgot the other philosophical questions, but these are the only most important ones. Dani thinks that the question "What defines a mindset" was a dumb question. In my opinion Dani is wrong.</p>

            <h3>D'gusto</h3>
            <p>Megan wanted to go with Milla to a food festival, Timo was just walking in the food festival and he encountered Megans mom, Megan then had the idea to summon the TTG to the festival. They ate hamburgers and Crepas and also talked</p>
            <p>Also, Sebas and Timo talk about all of their inside jokes and how there was lore to them. Basically, Sebas once made a joke during history about how he was the one that killed Lincoln by stealing John Wilkes Booth's skin, puting it on, and then framing him. During this festival, Sebs claims that he also started the witch trials because he hates skinwalkers. They also conclude that Megan is a skinwalker because she likes animals and she can't read. Also Milla is Jesus and Alex is a detective.</p>
            <p>All of these jokes ended up constructing some kind of story or lore. So they will ocassionaly make a jokes about Sebas participating in historic events a long time ago, Milla being one of the most famous people in the planet, Megan doing whatever skinwalkers do, Timo being a catalyst (he just really likes that word), and Alex conducting investigations. Fede is the only one that doesn't have a special title but he often stands against discrimination so you could say he is an activist. Later on they start making lore about others just for fun<a href="lore.html" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">.</a></p>
            <p>Before the group arrived at the festival, Timo bought a green mug because he liked how simple it was. It has absolutely no labels or any writing at all, its just a really cool shade of green. He thinks it would make a great gift because of how uniquely simple it was. But he doesn't know who to give it to.</p>
