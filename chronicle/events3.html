        <p>We have new students, that's great. Also the IB is starts in this chapter which is not great. People chose their IB subjects in 10nth grade but they didn't know that they would have certain limitations. Digital Society and Art Class are at the same time, same with Chemistry and Computer Science, and Physics and Biology. So some people had their classes changed without their consent.</p>
        <p>Also, here are the new students</p>

            <b>01/08/2022</b>
            <p>All the A Day classes are introduced. Mondays and Wednesdays are A days. All the students get a taste of what the next 2 years will be like and what they will be learning, aswell as whom they will be learning with. Doug Murphy is the new principal of the school, he is the father of new student Chad Murphy and he seems to be incredibly exited. There is music and free pencils at the entrance, and Murphy also gives a massive welcoming speech.</p>
            <p>During ToK, Turner introduces the syllabus and he also talks about his massive student debt. Turner usually goes into tangents about random topics because he knows a about many things like geology, english, philosophy, and so much more. It's very clear that this will be a very fun class where students will learn much more than just theory of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Also all the sciences are in the A days, those being Computer, Chem, Physics, and Bio.</p>
            <b>Interesting events</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Dani missed the first 2 days(this one and the next one) he has been bragging about how much ping pong he practiced in spain.</li>
              <li>Physics actually has a lot of people, but the surprising thing is that many people taking it as a Higher Level class. Sebas, Chad, Alex, Ethan, Timo, and Martina.</li>
              <li>Most people got confused with their schedule.</li>
              <li>Mr. Turner shows his students, his gigantic student debt</li>

            <p>Martina decides she might change to the other class's spanish.There are 2 ToK and Spanish classes, one group has Spanish in A days and ToK in B days while the other has Spanish in B days and ToK in A days. Martina has ToK in A days but that class has all boys except her.</p>
            <p>During Spanish class, everyone is tasked with writing about something that they like about taking the IB, something they don't like about taking the IB, and some question about the IB. Fede does this task. And then in the back of the paper he drew this and then he gave it to Timo</p>

            <p>The new advisory Teachers are Sylva, Mr.Foege, Ana, and Mr.Turner.</p>
            <p>How unfortunately that the advisoriy teachers were swapped, Ms Coyle and Mr Zarsky where truly the best Advisory teachers one could have.</p>
            <p>Also Lupinacci changed to Chemistry HL in case he wants to drop Math HL which is very demanding.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At the end of the day, Sebas asks Timo the reason of why he chose physics HL. Timo gives multiple reasons.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>He liked physics</li>
              <li>He wanted a challenge</li>
              <li>He had a dream where he was taking physics HL</li>
              <li>Martina was taking Physics HL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sebas thought that Timo's answer wasn't interesting enouph. So Sebas decided not to tell Timo the reason <b>he</b> took physics HL. And thus no one knows <i>Why Sebas took physics HL</i>. Timo really wants to know though, he is really curious. Sebas gives him a couple of hints.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cheese</li>
              <li>The reason was created when Timo told Sebas that Timo would take Physics HL (I didn't really understand this one)</li>
              <li>The reason has nothing to do with the people </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then Timo tells Sebas about the <a href="events3.html#ritual">ritual</a> that he found yesterday.</p>

              <li><p>Nicole listens to music with her airpods. Literally the whole class can hear her music because of how loud she was playing it, she does this in every class, until the teacher gets annoyed and tells her to lower the volume.</p></li>

            <p>At the end of the day, Sebas and Timo made a deal, if Timo showed Sebas the <a href="events3.html#ritual">ritual</a>, then Sebas would tell Timo the <a href="events3.html#physec">reason behind his decision for choosing physics HL</a>. Physics HL is one of the hardest IB courses, so it was very uncharacteristic of Sebs to take this course given his nonchalant demeanor, specially since he isn't planning to go to any university. Timo is happy about it though.</p>

          <p>Martina was really mad about the fact that she was not allowed to take Digital Society. Visual Arts and digital society are at the same time and Martina takes Visual Arts. Mili and Martina join a discord call and talk about it for a while, then Dani joins and then Timo joins.</p>
          <p>Dani helps martina write the mail to Doug Murphy as they discuss the goodness of the new principal. After that Martina takes the 16 personalities test</p>
          <p>Lucas and Lupi join, Lupi wants to do homework from biology with lucas, lucas told him to wait until he had taken a bath and eaten, so lupi deafens. Timo asks everyone how their day was.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Mili said it was nice, and then sheath asked back, Timo said it was also nice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lucas said that he was tired because he always arrived at home late since he did so many sports.</p></li>
            <li><p>Dani said it was stressing, since he didn't read Othello which he was supposed to read and he didn't like the idea of going to English class without having read the book, since he can't pull off quotations and does not know it that well</p></li>
            <li><p>Martina said she was very mad about the fact she could not take digital society</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>After that the group started talking about different IB subjects, and Math came up, in which Dani showed the amount of homework that the Math AA HL people have, it was huge, they had more than 15 assigments already. Then Dani says that Math AA HL people and Math AA SL people have a lot of beef, but Timo and Martina counter saying that Math AI SL and Math AA SL actually have more beef. And then everyone started fighting about which math class was better.</p>
          <p>Mili and Dani believed Math AA was better while Timo and Martina believed Math AI was better, and Lucas was just there. Sebas was currently in Math AA, however he wanted to change because he didn't like the way Ms Orrico taught. Mili said that Sebas wanted to stay in Math AA, but Timo differed. Mili texted sebas, and sebas said that he was going to stay in Math AA, then Timo texted Sebas, he told Timo "I never said for how long".</p>
          <p>Timo told Dani that Math AI taught you how to read between the lines and solve the problems more easily, thus it was more useful for physics, then Dani left the call without responding.</p>
          <p>Then Martina took many personality tests while Timo finished english homework, Martina retook the Hogwarts quiz which looked like fun, so Timo took it too. Martina got ravenclaw with an elephant patronus and Timo got Hufflepuff with a horse patronus.</p>
          <p>Then Mati joined, said hi and then everyone left</p>

            <h3>Wonderwall and Ping Pong</h3>
            <b>12/08/2022</b>
            <b>What?</b>
            <p>So in the breaks, Sofe, Ethan, Alex, Ethan, Timo, Fede, and Sebas have been sitting together at lunch often. This is a new group different from the Table Tube Gang.</p>
            <p>So everyone mentioned except Sofea and Ethan went to Alex's house to play super smash bros to Alex's house.</p>
            <p>Then the contingent started playing mario kart while Alex and Timo went to play ping pong outside, Timo won many times against Alex. With one match being 3 to 21. This night time was approaching and Timo could see better in the dark than Alex.</p>
            <p>Alex wanted to play doubles, but Timo once swore never to do that, ever since "the incident". Fede asked who hit Timo in the face with a paddle, Timo replied it was Martina.</p>
            <p>After that, they went to Rudy where they started interogating Eitoku, this is very common for Fede to do by they way. They asked Eitoku who was the person that he liked the least from the class. Eitoku gave it much thought, there are no bad people in the class, so Eitoku doesn't dislike anyone, however the person that Eitoku likes the least is Dani just because he seems to be serious all the time.</p>
            <p>Then they went back to Alex's house, they were planning to play Super Smash Bros but instead they watched the Minions movie while they answered Fede's questions.</p>
            <b>The deep questions</b>
            <p>Take into account that all of these answers are not really serious and they will definately change with the course of time. Also, at this point no one dislikes anyone (at least to my knowledge) this will also change int he future.</p>
            <p>Who do least like in the class</p>
            <ul>

              <li><p><b>Sebas:</b>Nicole</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Who do you like the most?</p>

            <b>13/08/2022</b>
            <p>The WWC minus Ethan, Eitoku, and Sofea, went to Sebas house. They ate balls of flour with pork and it was actually pretty good. They also had corn. </p>
            <p>They went outside and Timo started playing wonderwall with a guitar that Sebs had there</p>

            <p>Then Timo tried teaching Alex how to play wonderwall, but Alex gave up eventually. Then Sebas revealed that he had a gift for everyone, olive oil soap. It was amazing, it had the smell of olives. Then Timo started trying to learn how to speak french, Alex helped him to say "Airport" in french.</p>
            <p>Then Sebs starts drinking beer, and the mother offers Timo some beer. Timo explains he shouldn't drink because of a medical condition and the mother says that Timo already looked drunk and that's why she offered.</p>
            <p>Sebs and Timo then think of what to name their new group. They thought about naming it Wonder Weed Gang or something like that because of wonderwall, but Sebs proposed the word "Contingent" because it was a cool word. So the Wonder Weed Contingent. But then Timo renamed it to the Wander Warbler's Contingent because he liked the word Warbler. And thus the <a href="others.html#WWC">Wander Warbler's Contingent</a> got it's name</p>

Timo said that it was "Mr Green" and Sebas sait it was "Mr White". If Sebas won, Timo would give him one of his journals, if Timo won, Sebas would <b>have</b> to go to Martina's volleyball thing and also Dani's birthday (Sebas does not like to go to these Juntadas for some reason so this was a big deal) It was not Green or White, it was another random person so no one won anything</p>

            <p>Timo missed his prediction, but only barely, in the Original chemistry experiment, Mr.Green was the assasin, however Amaral changed the Document to make it Peacock, Timo tried to argue he was technically correct, but Sebass allowed no technicalities. </p>
            <p id="lies">Timo tells Sebas that <i>he has never lied</i>, and lies of evasion don't count because Timo doesn not believe those are lies, those are secrets. Sebas is surprised and he promises Timo to never lie. Sebas then lies 2 seconds after to Santino about some physics homework. Turns out lying is deep within Sebas' nature, he can't get rid of it.</p>
            <p>During advisory, Ethan asks Timo to tell him Sebas' Physics HL secret when Sebas reveals it. Timo does not agree to do this.</p>

            <p>Martina brought Fede and Chiara to her home, where they talked in Martina's room. Martina brewed some tea with sugar in a green mug. </p>
            <p>While Fede, Chiara, and Martina were talking, Timo was trying to find Martina's house in San Nicolas, until he eventually found it, when he arrived, they talked for a bit, Martina remarked that she did not want Eitoku to see a certain book in her desk. Everyone went outside and started preparing the volleyball and the football tennis net. The four started playing volleyball and people started arriving, Nikki, Angie, Eitoku, and Lupi arrived and they all played volleyball for a while, then Nikki left. Eitoku brought some Japanese food for everyone. There were some chocolate bars, some strange cheetos, and other things.</p>
            <p>Eitoku was too hot, but he didn't want to take his hoodie off since he had nothing below it, so Martina lend him a T-Shirt from Jeff's 3x3. They played a volleyball match, It was Martina, Lupi, and Angie against Chiara, Fede, and Eitoku. Lupi's team won 10 to 5.</p>
            <p>After that, everyone went inside to eat Ham & Cheese Sandwiches and Pizza. Ethan and Alex came while everyone was eating, then Salma and Mili came. Lupi found nerf guns, and he started a nerf war. But Martina didn't like the mess everyone was making. Martina decided that going to the park was a fantastic idea, and so everyone went to the park, but Timo was in the bathroom while this happened, so he got left in the house</p>
            <p>As everyone was going to the park, they were talking about stuff when Timo came running to them. In the park, they played in the swings and the games there, while talking about random stuff. Salma hadn't been in the class for a very big time. Martina got a call from Lucas, who was lost so Alex, her, and Timo went to find Lucas.</p>
            <p>After finding them, Alex and Martina went to Martina's house to recharge Martina's vape while Timo and Lucas went back to the park. Eitoku missed his dog from japan, so he stayed petting a dog that was there. Luca came and saw Timo walking towards the park, Luca thought he was lost, but Timo told him everyone was in the park, so the two of them went to the park.</p>
            <p>Lupi asked Timo where Martina had gone, and Timo told them they went to reacharge Martina's vape with Alex, Lupi then decided to go with them, and he ran towards Martina's house, forgetting his jacket and his phone. Alex and Martina saw Lupi coming, and Lupi told them everyone was coming back, Lupi then realised forgot everything at the park, so he had to got to get everything back. Everyone went to Martina's house again.</p>
            <p>After arriving at Martina's house, Dani arrived and rang the bell, they could see him in the screen.</p>

            <p>And everyone decided to surprisie him. Everyone hid, and when Martina opened the door, everyone sang happy birthday to him as he made his way to the couch. Martina, Fede and Timo put a candle on some sort of cake, and then gave it to Dani, who ate the cake, but regretted it since it had carbs.</p>
            <p>Everyone was talking in when suddenly, out of nowhere, Chiara starts counting, and everyone decides to play hide and seek.</p>

            <b>Alex and Lupi's little adventure</b>
            <p>Lupi and Alex were quickly found upstairs by Chiara and Eitoku, everyone except Martina got found, Dani told Alex and Lupi that Martina, Ethan, Eitoku, and Sofea had climbed over the fence in the house, so Alex and Lupi did the only reasonable thing, and they climbed the fence. They saw something reflecting light and thought it could ahve been someone's phone, but it was just a piece of plastic. A they were going back, a dog and a cat appear, and they look like they are going to fight, suddenly the cat attacks very aggresively and the dog is getting destroyed, Lupi intervenes and ends the fight. Lupi then wants to go to the bathroom, so he goes to the bushes, but there was a camera, and a guard came, he was mad at Lupi for doing what he did. After that they went back to Martina's house</p>
            <p>Turns out that Dani that Martina and Eitoku had gone to search for Timo in the park. Timo was in Abril's house, which was close to the park. They found Timo, and on the way back, they talked about the cold, and how Martina was cold, and wearing shorts. Then Eitoku got cold, and Timo suggested they learned how to breathe.</p>
            <p>And Sofe and Ethan were just talking in the playroom, so no one knows who Dani saw climbing over the fence.</p>
            <p>When Eitoku, Martina, and Timo, Alex and Lupi were still on their... adventure, everyone was playing cards with loud music in the living room, Eitoku and Timo went to Martina's room, Martina owned a guitar that she never used. Timo and Eitoku played the guitar, and then everyone else went to Martina's room. Martina got really nerveous and anxious since she did not want anyone to see the book that was in her desk. Chiara noticed this and made everyone leave, except some members of the WWC members + Martina. Apparently Martina was going to Japan with Eitoku, and everyone else thought it nice to join them. However Martina expressed how travelling with multiple people was annoying, a feeling only Fede seemed to understand</p>
            <p>While they were talking about going to Japan, Alex and Lupi came back from their adventure, Lupi joined the boys, downstairs who had started a nerf war. Alex went upstairs were he saw Dani leaving Martina's room because of Chiara kicking everyone out, Dani then took of his shirt and started flexing his muscles to Alex in front of a mirror, right outside Martina's room. After that people started once again going inside Martina's room, then everyone went out for the last Time.</p>
            <p id="theplanfails">Alex played Football Tennis with some other people, while others were piggy back riding Lupi. Timo went with Ethan and Sofe to chat about random things.</p>
            <p>But suddenly, Lupi urgently invities Timo outside of the room where Ethan and Sofe resided. Lupi guided him outside where everyone else was. Turns out they were all watching Ethan and Sofe talk, hoping that they would get together. Timo tried to inform them that Sofe had a boyfriend, but it wasn't very effective. Then he went inside were Dani and Alex were talking about life. Meanwhile at another part of the house some girls were talking different kinds of vapes and about beauty. People started joining the conversation. Chiara started talking about her dreams, apparently Chiara has really strange dreams including one dream where Martina was stalking her and like trying to kill her or something.</p>
            <p>Then they talked about their biggest fear, Fede said it was really tight spaces, which Salma found incredibly stupid, saying she would have imagined something like "dying alone". Chiara said that it was stupid to be claustrophobic and that she liked being squished, most people found the comment weird, and she had to specify that she meant being squished by 2 people while sitting. Chiara said her biggest fear was being murdered in her sleep or getting sex traficked</p>
            <p>Dani was asked what his biggest fear was, but Dani has no fear because he is the alpha male and the only thing an alpha male fear is fear itself.</p>
            <p>After that all the girls left and Martina was alone the only girl left. Luca was annoyed that Mati found Luca's entire family in facebook, and that Santino was trying to sleep with his second cousin. Martina told everyone to "spill the tea" but Lupinacci countered saying that that boys don't have tea. Martina asked "what do boys do then"? you may be asking yourself the same question. Boys do pushups and planks apparently.</p>
            <p>So Dani and Luca had a competition to see who could do a plank for longer, Dani won.</p>
            <div class="img si25">

            </div>
            <p> Timo then went to check on Sofe and Ethan. Apparently Sofe's boyfriend sent a photo of himself with another girl on his shoulder. Sofe had been having a mental breakdown about this for the past 1 hour and 30 minutes, maybe she is a bit jealous. Ethan was quite tired of it. In retalliation Sofe sent his boyfriend a picture with Ethan and Timo. Turns out Timo happened to know Sofe's boyfriend from a studying christian club that they used to go to. His name is Juampi</p>
            <p>After that, all the WWC members left, then Dani and Luca left, and Matias and Martina talked for a bit, until Mati left.</p>
            <p>Timo forgot his hairbrush and Fede forgot his jacket</p>

            <p>In physics, the class starts the topic of kinematics, and Seba informs Timo that he had lied multiple times thus breaking the promise that he woudln't lie, but at least he was honest about it.</p>

          <b>26/08/2022</b>
          <p>So clapping is a way to mock Eitoku about liking Martina. However Eitoku always says he doesn't like Martina. I think it's because they were once trying to catch a mosquito in a bus or something and they were clapping? I am not sure though. Anyways Timo figured it out so now Alex owes him cake. Eitoku gets annoyed by people clapping very easily.</p>
          <p>In advisory, they talk about the field trip to pan de azucar.</p>
          <p>In Math, Martina claims to be learning french, Salma disagrees with this, saying that Martina knows italian not french. Then Sebas and Timo talk about languages for the rest of the class, Sebas started following him on duolingo.</p>
          <p>In the last class, spanish, Dani stole Timo's diary and read, "Alex won't be clapping today" and Dani is confused so Timo explained how clapping was a way of mokcing Eitoku and all of that, but Martina wasn't here today so Alex wouldn't clap. Ethan heard something and he got curious but Timo didn't want to explain everything all over again. So Ethan asked Alex and Alex gave him so very very not subtle hints, so Ethan immediately understood what clapping means.</p>
          <p>After that Mili, Eitoku, Chiara, and angie, and maybe someone else that I don't remember do something [EDIT: I am an idiot I actually wrote this and now I don't remember what the hell they did].</p>

          <p>The Warblers go to Timo's house and play Super Smahs Bros and also study for physics, Timo also gave a room tour of his various objects. Timo wanted to take Sebas to the ritual, but he could'nt since they did not have time.</p>
          <p>In the groupchat, Mili asks when the UP test is. Lucas responds with the question "Can you read?"(Because the information that Mili was searching for is in google classroom) Then everyone makes fun of Mili for like 30 minutes.</p>
          <p> Alex, Sebas, and Timo try to create art by burning wood with magnyfying glasses, but it's too cloudy so they couldn't do anything.</p>

          <p>The UP class had a test, and in TOK, everyone was lauphing at Mili for asking the groupchat for answers instead of checking google classroom, while Timo tried defending her.</p>
          <p>In chemistry, Timo tried convincing Sebas to tell him the <a href="events3.html#physec">Physics Secret</a> by trying to trade it for <a href="events.html#dream">his predictions</a> but Sebas refused, saying he would only give Timo the secret when he saw <a href="events3.html">the ritual</a>.</p>
          <p>Martina said she would join a chearleading team that would be created by Chiara, Timo considers joining.</p>

          <p>Martina then tells Timo that she is trying to prove to Eitoku that she is worst than him at Vollayball, and so they are going to compete, to see who is the worst at volleyball. But they ended up doing a bottle flip challenge, which Martina lost. So I guess she is the worst.</p>

          <p>In math class, Sebass, Timo, Eitoku, and Sofe talk all class since Zarsky is not there to teach anything. So Martina, Eitoku, and Timo do some duolingo in japanese.</p>
          <p>Sofe suggests that they could do something on friday since it is a half day, they decide to go to portones and eat something there on the friday half day.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Then the Wine and Cheese happened, an event where parents and Teachers come and talk to each other while eating wine and cheese. The parents sometimes bring their kids, so high school and middle school students have to baby-sit them.</p>
          <p>Chiara, Salma, Eitoku, Mati, and Fede came. And Chiara brought his brother, Tiago, who is really hyperactive. Eitoku and Timo showed each other their guitar, piano, and trumpet skills. Martina came, and joined by Chiara, they went to the music room.</p>
          <p>They played some songs, then Eitoky was called by his dad, and Martina and Timo met Eitoku's dad, after that they all ate burritos with chips while talking about Tiago's hyperactivity</p>
          <p>After that many people left with Salma's mom. Tiago learned to play ping pong, and tomorrow it's Alexia's birthday.</p>

            <h3>The portones warblers</h3>
            <p>When the half day ended, the WWC minus fede, alex, and sebas went to portones shopping. While going there, Eitoku asked Timo about Dani, Timo said that Dani was an interesting person who always overanalysed everything. Dani might seem cold hearted but he is a good person, he just hates to show it. Dani likes helping others which is proof that he is good. Fede, Alex, and Chad had NHS.</p>
            <p>After they ate, Ethan said that Dani was a very bad person and that he hated him because he is conceited and racist and a mysoginist bitch. Timo tried to defend him but he failed. Ethan actually hates Dani a lot.</p>
            <b>Ethan's opinions on dani</b>
            <div id="ethanhate" style="
            background-color: salmon;
            border: 3px groove salmon;
            ">
              <p>Once upon a time, Ethan and Dani were on a History grou project together with Mr Foege as the teacher. Ethan already had his doubts about Dani and the jokes he made. They needed to do a presentation together. Dani "didn't do shit"(-Ethan) and he sent an apologising gmail to Ethan saying that he was sorry for leaving Ethan to do 90% of the work (Ethan hated this part specially because apparently Dani actually did nothing, not even 10% of the work). Dani added that he had other more important things to do and he couldn't focus on History. Now Ethan also had some very important things to do, so he got extremely mad at Dani for trying to make an excuse for not doing anything.</p>
              <p>After this, Ethan always saw Dani with a negative light. All of Danis strange jokes and comments on women and stuff like that landed terribly with Ethan. In Ethan's defense, Dani has a very unique way of expressing his thoughts, and his thoughts are also pretty unique too. Also Dani can sometimes dismiss people's opinions simply because he doesn't consider them smart.</p>
              <b>What Ethan hates of Dani</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Doesn't care about others</li>
                <li>Conceited</li>
                <li>He is sexist, mysoginist, many of the ist's (This one is debatable)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>But Ethan still jokes with him and pretends everything is fine.</p>
            </div>
            <p>After that they talk about Lore. Ethan establishes that in the lore. He wants to be an artist that is searching for the ultimate art piece. They start talking about art, debating which art is the best. It's mainly between Music and Drawing.</p>
            <p>After that, they talked about their social life, Sofe is going to an art exhibit with his boyfriend, Ethan said he had no social life, and Eitoku said that he is going to go to Martina's house with Angie and Mili.</p>
            <p>After that, Ethan and Sofe left, and while Eitoku and Timo sat down and waited. They talked about music, and the songs that they made and the different instruments they knew. Eitoku said he wished that IB had Music. Also Eitoku started playing the cuatro before the guitar which is a pretty interesting instrument with four thick strings that resembles a stranger base.</p>
            <p>After that Eitoku went to Martina's house to hang out and Timo went to Arocena</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Chiara's Thing</h3>
            <p>Timo and Chiara talk about school, the IB, physics, biology, and psychology. So the bio class had a test that was pretty touph. Then chiara mad some waffles to eat and her dog started barking. Mili, Martina, Angie, and Eitoku arrive.</p>
            <p>The girls styled Eitoku's hair (badly) while Chiara and Timo had a sword fight with a sword and it's sheath (plastic sword obviously). This was all happning in Chiara's room. Chiara won and Eitoku did not like what the girls did with his hair. After that Ethan came, who expected Chiara's room to be more pink. Chiara is always talking about the colour pink and how it's her favourite colour, however she argued that people don't eat their favourite food every day.</p>
            <p>After that all of them went down a suspicious and slow elevator that took them to the fun part of the house, complete with alcoholic beverages, cars, trophies, and a pool table. They talked there for a while, and then Angie and Salma arrived. Then, Dani and Luca arrived. They went down to the fun part of the house, although Dani did not trust the elevator, and so decided to go throught the alternative longer route.</p>
            <p>Dani then decided to play pool, and Martina fell asleep in a couch. Dani and Luca vs Ethan and Angie, Angie turned out to be really good at pool, and Dani turned out to be really bad, and so Angie and Ethan won. Mili left, saying that she would come back</p>
            <p>After that, everyone went upstairs to eat pizza when Alex and Fede arrived they talked about the immposible physics test and then Chad arrived, everyone was really hype for Chad, he is a really cool guy. Then Lupi came.</p>
            <p>After that everyone went down to play pool once again, This time, it was Timo and Eitoku vs Ethan and Luca. Eitoku got a streak were he scored like 5 balls in a row, and then he pulled of a move that can only be described as very good. So Luca an Ethan gave up.</p>
            <p>After that Lupi and Martina vs Chad and Alex, Chad and Alex started off winning, however Lupinacci and Martina took it over, but then Chad and Alex caught up to them so Martina and Lupi lost.</p>
            <p>After that it was Martina and Lupi vs Ethan and Luca, however in the middle of the game, Martina got drunk and high and decided not to play anymore, being replaced by Timo. Timo and Lupi managed to win. Then Mati arrived</p>
            <p>After that Eitoku and Timo went up agains't Chad and Alex, Chad and Alex started winning by a lot, and then they spent 1.5 hours trying to win until Eitoku and Timo catched up. While the very big game was happening, Alex wanted to teach eitoku how to tie his shoes really fast, Martina learned how to do it much quicker than Eitoku, and then she became even faster than Alex. Take into account Martina was also really drunk right now. Timo set up a trap where the 8-ball was really close to a hole, and Alex scored the 8-ball in the hole making him and Chad lose.</p>

            <p>After that, the they started asking deep questions, one of which was "What turns you on?" which Timo and Fede lauphed at. This is because Fede once asked Alex this question and Alex answered "Chocolate" which Fede found funny.</p>
            <p>Then people started leaving, and that is all.</p>

          <p>Dani tries to immitate Mr.Turner's language in TOK, which is very articulate, eloquent, and unique, using very interesting words.</p>
          <p>Mr Turner posts a question assigment on google classroom and everyone must answer it. Dani aswered this question vaguely with a sentence fragment and a grammatical error. So everyone corrected his comment. Then Santino copy and pasted a summary of a different short story.</p>

            <b>The beginning</b>
            <p>At school, everyone is there, Ethan and Martina did not bring their guitar, going against Eitoku and TImo. Timo forgot his towel and Mati forgot his sleeping bag, once in the bus, some sleep, some listen to music, some talk. But after a while the class arrives upon a gas station where they go to the bathroom and stock up in consumables before the first adventure.</p>
            <p>Sylvia collects phones, some don't give it to her, Timo gives Sylvia a non-functional phone, not knowing he had his actual phone in his back pack.</p>
            <p>They go to a cerro, and Friolla introduces herself as the guide, along with, the veterinarian, they both warn the young adventurers of dangerous snakes capable of causing trouble, then they give the group some food like popcorn, cheese chips that taste terribly, one jar of nuts, and fruit.</p>
            <div class="img ">
              <img src="new/rockmore/lupiandnikki.JPG" class="si49i2">

              <p class="itg">The arrive</p>
            </div>
            <p>The journey starts and 5 minutes in, Martina is already regretting every life choice that lead her to this moment. She says she is too tired to continue. Timo and Eitoku are perfectly fine, but all 3 are really behind and should probably run to catch up, but they don't</p>
            <p>So they arrive late to an explanation of tree clusters, random clusters of various species of trees, one of which is really allergic. There is a type of tree that if Chiara touches she dies but I don't remember the name (It's because she is allergic to something in the trees). The group is tasked with identifying every type of tree in the cluster, no one actually does the task because no one knows anything, except maybe Fede. So they move on.</p>
            <p>They climb a portion of the hill to arrive at a ravine with water.They leave their bags in a clearing and go down the ravine in order to taste nature's life-giving juices (Water). Martina challenged Timo to a race down to the entrance of the ravine, Timo accepted. Due to the inclination of the terrain, Timo won since his longer legs allowed him to travel a larger distance with every step in an inclined plane, and Martina is short. In the ravine Alex falls, because he was not paying attention at the slippery, wet, mossy rock.</p>
            <p>After some nice fresh water in everyone's system, the team comes back out of the ravine, and eats the empanada's that the guides gave them, Ethan can't eat ham, so Timo trades him the ham empanada for a chicken one.</p>

            </div>
            <p>After that, they ascend the hill, to a place that has a sign which warns the class about the zone being inhabited by extraterrestrial being and there are high chances of alien abduction. Timo builds some stone structures while Dani and Lupi do an amazing job at absolutely destroying Timo's structures.</p>

            <p>On they way down, Martina loses her love stone (A stone she has in her collar) but she finds in her bra. Mati and Lupi take cool pictures in sunglasses. Timo also lost his back pack but he recovered it from the Alien abduction zone.</p>
            <p>Now with no missing items, the adventurers go down, this Time, instead of drinking the water, they are planning to bathe in it, Dani takes of his shirt to show everyone his <a href="events.html#alpha">alpha-male</a> physique. Lupi, Mati, San, Nikki, and others also go to the water. Lucas jumps in with his clothes. The water was cold and San destroyed his foot against a rock.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Then everyone got out, complimenting Dani and Lupi on their bodies. Then everyone goes down the hill. Martina is absolutely exhausted from the climb, even having to stop walking because she feels she could not possibly walk another step. Timo jokingly asks her if she wants to race again ( expecting an exhausted "no" as an answer) but Martina instead responded by drawing energy from the sun and running as fast as she possibly could towards Salma (Salma was picked as the finishline) and she won and then she died.</p>
            <p>After that, Timo raced Eitoku to the bus. But Timo stopped halfway because he was carrying a back pack.</p>
            <p>The team went to the bus and headed to the incrdible Piedra Mora, the place where the cabins are located</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Piedra Mora</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The girls have their cabin, the boys have their cabin, and the WWC also has their own cabin, but also Chad is in the WWC cabin. This can happen because Sofe is currently suffering from an infirmity and thus she couldn't come. Sofe is the only girl in the WWC which means that all the WWC members in the camp got a cabbin for themselves, and also Chad joined them. After spending some time talking and playing ping pong, everyone joins a soccer match in whitch Lupi, Luca, Timo, and Mati score enouph goals to win a match. The teachers were also playing, and at one point, Turner charged towards his opponent's goal with the ball, but he started to fumble and tumble untill he fell very epicly and it was really funny.</p>
            <p>Then the merienda comes, and everyone eats. They have bread with dulce de leche and also Alex's favourite drink. Chocolate Milk</p>
            <p>Then they have free time, during the free time, everyone is allowed to do anything, like ping pong, and more.</p>
            <p>From now on, the Girl's Cabin is Gcab, the Boy's Cabin is Bcab, and the Wonder Warblers Contingent Cabin is the Wcab</p>
            <p>Martina spends a lot of time in the Wcab, she claims she has no fun in the Gcab. Ethan theorises that Martina actually spends more time in Wcab because she is infatuated with Eitoku, Timo believes that Martina is actually in love with Eitoku and not just infatuated.</p>
            <p>Then dinner</p>
            <p>And then, a game is played, 4 teams are made randomly, and they have to find the guides who are making animal sounds that the group should be capable of recognising. Turner is incredibly hard to find.</p>
            <p>Mr.Turner felt bad that Sebas past right in front of him and did not notice so he revealed himseslf and the red team won.</p>
            <p>Another game was played, where the team had to get inside a circle without getting spotted by Mr.Turner with a flash light, the game is as hard as its sounds and everyone got mad at how hard the game was. The only one who got in was Martina who used Timo's military flash light in strobe light mode to flash the teachers, blinding them to the point where they couldn't recognise who was getting inside the circle. This strategy was then banned since that flash light is actually really bright and no one else got it. Others tried to use their jackets to cover themselves, and also switch up their clothes, but nothing worked because the teachers just started guessing names until they guessed correctly.</p>
            <p>Then they made a campfire where Eitoku and Timo played wonderwall. Then Ethan, Timo, and Turner Talk about dreams and predictions, apparently Timo is not the only one with <a href="events.html#dream">predictions</a> Turner has them too</p>

            <p>Then some play ping pong some go to sleep, and some talk in the campfire, Timo loses his pick, his guitar, and his flashlight, but finds everything with the help of Sebas, Alex, and Marinta.</p>
            <p>And then everyone talks in their own cabin for a bit. The WWC agrees that they are going to keep everything in their cabin clean. They will leave their shoes at the entrance and they would spray the place with some spray that I think Alex or someone had. Their cabin was the most pleasent, (The girl's cabin had the smell of vape which I didn't like)</p>
            <p>Timo and Sebas discuss death, apparently both are really scared of death and not knowing what come after. Ethan joins the talk, for a while and then he draws something on one of Timo's physical <a href="events3.html#journals">Journal</a></p>

            <h2>A Complex Camp 2</h2>
            <b>08/09/2022</b>
            <p>Some kids from a nearby Rural show up, and the class introduces itself while teaching them some words in foreign. After that, the guides anounced that the class would have to do activities with the kids, Timo was wearing a hat with a neck flap that Martina stole from him 3 times. They played an activity where they have to identify plants in order to find papers that allow them to do a challenge, like volleyball, jumping rope, and other things. There was a kid called, Gael, who was really mean and was acting really innapropiately towards the girls of his class.</p>

            </div>
            <p>After those activities, the class along with the rural school kids, had lunch together, and they ate Chivito and other things that the kids cultivated themselves. Timo and Martina had a staring contest which Timo lost.</p>
            <p>Then the WWC + Chad sing Happy Birthday to Alex, and everyone including the kids sing him happy birthday too, this time it actually is his birthday though.</p>
            <p>The kids lost the ping pong ball, and Alex, Rodrigo, and Chad were all really mad that they were unable to play ping pong, but luckily, Timo had brought a ping pong ball. Then he gave it to the ping pong squad and they played for a long time.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Bcabin was struggling because everything was flooded, dirty, and smelled terribly, the Gcabin was vaping, with phones, and talking about gossip and tea.</p>
            <p>In the Gcabin, Martina was talking with everyone, while Timo decided to go to sleep, when he woke up everyone was leaving to somewhere quite cool.</p>
            <b>The reserve.</b>
            <p>The class went to a reserve that was maintained by the guides. It had a mudhouse, and wilderness, Sebas and Timo found great walking sticks. The group ate some sandwiches and then got split into 2, and they set up 2 motion activated cameras, one per group. They met up in a river and they had to get to the other side in order to get to a river-made labyrinth. </p>
            <div class="img si40">
              <img src="new/rockmore/sandwiches.JPG" class="ing">
              <p class="itg">They eat sandwiches and oranges</p>
            </div>
            <p> Sebas gave his walking stick to San, San then gave it to Lupi, and Lupi left it in the river. Some people crossed the river, Martina was the only girl that dared, Nice one Martina. Everyone in the labyrinth found their way to a clearing, except for Timo, whom Alex and Ethan followed. Timo got to a dead end, but dead ends are only a mindset, so Timo made his own path by destroying the vegetation wall and he got to the clearing.</p>

            <p>On the way back to the mud place, Timo took the camera, and took some pictures, none were good, but he liked the experience. And Martina stole Timo's hat and gave it to Lupi.</p>
            <div class="img">

            <p id="died">After that, the Adventurers drank Alex's favourite drink, chocolate milk and ate alfajores, then they went back, where Lupi apologised to Sebas for leaving the good walking stick begins behind. Sebas says that he will see Lupi as his stick from now on. Then everyone starts trying to catch frogs Sebas then asks Timo what he thinks of Eitoku and Martina. He responds that he is jealous of Martina and how she always "steals" Eitoku from them. Timo makes the joke that they should get rid of the competition, Sebs disagrees witht the violent approach.</p>
            <p>Also Martina was throwing rocks at at people. In one occassion Fede asked her to stop</p>

            </div>
            <p>Then they went back to piedra mora, where Timo, Lupi, Rodrigo, Alex, and Chad played ping pong for a while. Then Martina and Timo come to Wcabin where Timo teaches Martina some of the guitar chords. Then they go to Gcabin, where all the girls are using their vapes and their phones, they always locked the door and closed all curtains to assure that no teacher could find out they had illegal OEE items. Also, Nicole rested her head on Lupi's lap and everyone found that strange.</p>
            <p>Then, Timo tries to teach Wonderwall to Mati, but Mati gives up really quickly.</p>
            <p>After that, the boys have the amazing idea to go to the pool, but a storm comes and they get scared of the lightning. They go back to their cabin, but they are all all wet and muddy so they make a disaster in the cabin. This only happens in the boy's cabin though, so Bcabin is all muddy and dirty.</p>

            </div>
            <p>After that, they once again come back to piedra mora. In the girls cabin, some people are talking, including Martina, Mati, and Timo, Timo notices Martina, Mati, and CHiara leaving, and so he leave with them to the Wcabin. It turns out, that both don't like how Nicole and Lupi were acting the other day (Nicole had her head on Lupi's), Martina says she does not like Nicole's attitude towards boys, and Mati says that Nicole is allowed to do whatever she wants, and that the real problem is that Lupi let her rest her head.</p>
            <p>Everyone but Martina goes back to the Gcabin to investigate. Everyone talks about random things, until Dani asks a very strange and extraneous and interesting question that he had apparently asked before. However this question was expressed as a euphemism </p>
            <blockquote id="dani!?">
              <p>"How big is your wall?"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The question was directed to girls. But no one really understood what Dani meant. Dani kept saying that everyone knew what he meant but they seriously had no idea (At least I had no idea). Then Dani decided to use no Euphemisms, these are Dani's words verbatim</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"The distance between the entrance of your pussy and your womb."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>No one replied with an actual answer because of the complete absurdity and innapropiateness of the question. Then they started talking about beauty, where Dani was asked "What do you look for in a girl?" he responded with "Everything" and then proceeds to explain to everyone a metaphor of a cake that represents the woman's body (This can't ger worse can it?). Again, in Dani's words verbatim</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"The ass is the base of the cake and the breasts are the frosting"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And with that, Timo could no longer tolerate Dani so he left. He went to the Wcabin where Ethan, Alex, and Martina were talking, and he told them that Dani had just asked the most insane question. Reasonably, everyone begged Timo to tell them what the question was, but Timo was too embarassed to do it, so after a lot of insisting, Timo flipped a coin to decide. The coin said yes. Timo told them the euphemism "How big is your wall" which no one understood the true meaning of.</p>
            <p>They once again begged Timo to explain what the hell does that mean, so he flipped another coin, and the coin told Timo yes again. However Timo was too embarassed to say it, so he wrote it on his diary and gave the paper to Alex, who read it out loud. And to everyone's surprise, Martina had already heard this question from Dani, he had texted her that question, and other similar questions before. So everyoen is kind of weirded out by Dani's question and no one can quite figure out his reasoning or why he would ask such an innapropiate question. San arrives and gives his opinions on Dani, which is in line with everyone else's</p>
            <p id="curse">Meanwhile, Sylvia goes into the Gcabin, and eveyone hides their forbidden items, Sylvia somehow does not notice the intense vape odour and simply tells everyone to go to the dining room. Before they go, Timo gives Martina a little white ball with a strange symbol</a>.</p>
            <p>After that, Mr Turner plans to do some slow shutter speed photography art, but is interrupted by the rain. Still he managed to do something.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>If you have the joker card, you can add a rule</li>
              <li>Play the game like Uno but you have to say Whitejack when you place the last card</li>
              <li>Chad always start, if no Chads are present, the name closest to Chad starts.</li>
              <li>The last card placed has to be plus or minus 1 number away from the card in the pile. It can't be exactly the same number</li>
              <li>When you have 2 cards, say "Blackjack" before your turn ends</li>
              <li>When you have 1 card, say "UNO" before your turn ends</li>
              <li>When you get a card with a person, switch your cards with the person to your left.</li>
              <li>You can say "Adjourn" and leave the game, giving your cards to someone else of your choosing, however the next time that you play the game you have to do 20 push ups.</li>
              <li>When you have 10 cards, you automatically give 8 to any person you want to</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then everyone plays minute games, games tha have to do with 1 minute, everyone </p>

Lupi was the detective, the first mafia got discovered right away. But the second was unkown. They were in the finals. Chad, Mili, Lupi, Timo and Turner are still standing. Lupi is the detective, he knows who is the killer, Lupi says it's Turner, but Mili says she knows it's Chad, people vote Turner out, Chad kills Timo. So Mili, Lupi, and Chad, are left, and Mili gets voted out. Lupi teamed up with Chad, betraying all the citizens, and stealing Alex's title as the worst detective ever. Dani found it hilarious though. Poor Dani was killed first, he is always killed first in mafia games.</p>

          <p>The WWC was summoned to a korean restaurant in ciudad vieja. Timo accidentally arrives 4 hours early to Alex's house because of some unexpected occurences.</p>
          <p>Alex was surprised, and he did some chores. Both Timo and Alex went to a nearby store to buy some snacks. Alex asked if the "Bridge" wafers were good, and Timo said that they were really good, but they tasted even better when frozen. Fede then tells Alex via messages that he might arrive a little earlier than expected, Alex is completely fine with this since Timo already woke him up.</p>
          <p>Then Sebas, Fede, Ethan, and Chad arrived and went to a bus to go to the korean restaruant. While going there, Sebas and Timo discussed which languages should be the official WWC language, but they could not agree on any.</p>
          <p>In the restaurant they ate spicy food, and Timo told Sofe some tales of the camp since she missed it because she was sick.</p>

          <p>After that, Fede, Chad, and Alex took a bus. Sebas, Timo, Sofe, and Eitoku went walking, then took a bus, but said that they ran all the way there to sound cooler. After that they play super smash bros, turns out Eitoku is cracked at super smash bros and he destroyed everyone.</p>

          <p>In ToK class, the boys of ToK make fun of the girls for giving bad reviews about the camp, commenting on how they are so dependent on their phones and addicted to vapes. Fede was not there, Fede would have probably found a way to end this. Fede's absence was most likely the reason that the ToK class was able to continue talking bad about the girls for the entire period.</p>

            <p>People play ping pong and eat brownies. And Chad officially joined the WWC</p>
            <p>Timo gives everyone present a <a href="events.html#clovers">4 leaf clover</a></p>
            <p>They talked about how no one should take Dani seriously.</p>
            <p>Then they went outside since Alex's father had some guests, they played ping pong and immediately went back to work. They worked on many things like math, biology, chemistry, physics.</p>
            <p>Then Eitoku and Timo took a big break in which they played a game of ping pong to 111, which ended up in a tie. Then they did more homework. Dani called Chad's phone and Chad helped him with Math. Then Mono called Timo, and Timo helped him with chemistry.</p>
            <p>Eitoku got added to <a href="events.html#thelore">the lore</a> as a biologist that was a cat and an orangutan which is allergic to nutella because of the palm oil and the fact that orangutans die because palm oil causes deforestation. <a href="events.html#speaches">Alex's speach</a> was about this problem.</p>
            <p>After Timo finished helping Mono, everyone said hi to Dani, Dani asked for a tour of Alex's house, and Alex game him the tour. And then Timo, Alex, and Chad played ping pont. In the first match, Dani and Timo talked about interesting things like calories, and Sebas, and how it was nice to study with other people, while Timo showed Dani the ping pong match, in which Chad won against Alex.</p>
            <p>Then Timo went against Alex, it was getting dark and Timo can see better in the dark than Alex so Timo won 6-21. He also destroyed Chad for the same reason, and then destroyed Chad again. Dani was spectating the ping pong match all this time through the phone.</p>
            <p>Then they went to do homework again, where Dani was helped by Chad and Fede while Sebas and Alex did chemistry homework.</p>

            <h2>Secrets and the Ritual</h2>
            <p>The plan was simple, Timo walks to arocena, meets with Sebas, they go to Timo's house, then they go to the ritual, and Sebas tells him the <a href="events3.html#physec">reason behind why he chose physics HL</a>.</p>
            <p>The story starts with Timo, who was walking around as he usually does, when he stumbles upon Lucas Fiandra, who was chilling outside the tennis courts. Timo and Lucas said hi, but TImo didn't stay long since he had to meet up with Sebas. Then Timo saw a black haired girl who looked like Chiara, Timo was very conspicuously trying to figure out if she was Chiara, but was doubting it since Chiara's hair is brown not black.</p>
            <p>Chiara then unexpectedly turns around and greets Timo who was taken by surprise. She dyed her hair black.</p>
            <p id="dief">Sebas and Timo also see Martina who was apparently meeting up with Chiara at starbucks for unkown reasons. Timo and Sebas go to starbucks and talk about a lot of stuff. They mainly noted how Martina survived <a href="events3.html#die1">two</a> <a href="events3.html#die2">murders</a> which was kinda crazy. Then they went for a walk.</p>
            <p>They went to see if Lucas on the tennis fields, but he wasn't, then they went back to starbucks, said hi to Chiara and Martina who were on their phones, then they went to a shady corner, where Timo informed Sebas what he had learned about Chiara at Mati's birthday. Chiara had said (while drunk) that she lies a lot and that she is sad.</p>
            <p>Sebs noted how Chiara and Martina were on their phones instead of talking to each other, although Timo hadn't noticed. Then Timo infomred Sebas that Bruno knew a lot about drugs, and that he had done them, specifically LSD. Then they they talked about more random stuff, like drugs, and more.</p>
            <p>Then they walked around more, talking about the french people, about a potential last senior trip, and about dresses. They also talked about the origin of the lore, then they started walking to Salma's house since Sebas was curious to know where it was, but they had to turn back since they might not have made it to the bus in time. Then they went to the bus station.</p>
            <p>In the bus ride, Timo complain about how being tall is bad because you are always uncomfortable everywhere. Sebas and Timo then start to argue about a hypothetical scenario. If a bunch of women where placed on one side of the earth, and a bunch of men where placed on the other side, and both groups were tasked to defeat the opposite gender, who would win? Timo argued women were smarter and thus they could get technology before men, Sebas argued men are stronger. They also talked about how cool Alex is</p>
            <p>Then they arrived to Timo's house, where they got ready for the expedition. Sebas grabbed a lego ninja handbook, and Timo grabbed her adventurous spirit.</p>
            <p>They went on bikes, and they were talking about the physics, while Timo showed off his ability to ride the bike without hands. Then Timo fell. They made their way to the <a href="events3.html#ritual">abandoned neighborhood</a> where Timo pointed out some clues that this was an abandoned neighborhood, like the sewer system, and how the ruins of the entrance where demolished.</p>
            <p>Sebas tends to always do what is easier, so it was really strange for him to take what is considered the hardest class of the IB (According to Mr Lopez). They approached the ritual, and Sebas revealed <a href="events3.html#physec">his reason for picking Physics HL</a> instead of Biology HL.</p>
            <p>Timo was in shock. One of Sebas' clues was a lie, which made it immposible for Timo to luckily guess it or figure it out since Timo is quite lucky. Sebas reflects on how it was a stupid decision to make, but Timo differs. Plus it's much cooler than Timo's reason for joining physics which was mostly because of a dream he had.</p>
            <p>Timo kicked the center of the ritual, destroying it, since it would be the last, and most important time he would visit it. Sebas fears that they just got cursed for all eternity. And they took a live photo.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Then Sebas revealed that Eitoku already knew his physics HL secret. Timo was absolutely furious at how Sebas told Eitoku before him. Anyways, by this point everyone has the suspicion that Eitoku like Martina, that's why they made the clapping joke. However Timo thought it was only a joke and Eitoku didn't actually like her. This is mainly due to Timo asking Eitoku and Eitoku clearly stating he doesn't like Martina. Sebas thought Timo already knew the truth, so Sebas accidentally revealed that</p>

            <p>Sebas also talked about other stuff. But I don't think this time it was really that relevant to the chronicle. These secrets only added to the feeling of complexity throughout this chapter. Timo was surprised about Eitoku liking Martina because Eitoku had explicitly told him that he didn't. Timo says he is going to try to get Eitoku to tell him the truth. Timo also asked Sebas who was the coolest person Sebas has met, Sebas said that it was someone whom he slept in a bench with. Then they reflected on their reasons behind choosing physics IB and how logic was not one didn't play a huge part in the decision making progress. On their way back home they talked about how everything is connected and there is power in belief. Then they arrived at Timo's house, and Seba left.</p>

            <p>The WWC minus Timo and Alex go to expresso pocitos to meet there. Then they start going to Rudy's, but they get a call from Alex, saying that he jus arrived at expresso pocitos, then Timo joins them, and they go back for Alex.</p>
            <p>After that the WWcc walks to Rudy's, Timo tells Sofe about some story from the camp. Fede jokingly hates on Chad for being straigh, white, blonde, and from the US.</p>
            <p>Then they to Rudy's, and they talked about the relationship between weight and height, and beauty. Sofe, Sebas, and Eitoku were really tired.</p>
            <p>Timo confronts Eitoku about Martina, and Eitoku tells Timo that he once liked Martina, but because of "many reasons". This makes sense to Timo.</p>
            <p>The WWC sings happy birthday to Alex and they get Rudy, to get him a chocolate cake with a candle. It's not Alex's birthday</p>
            <p>Then they played a game with cards, the cards where circle shaped and had several objects on them, all cards have one object in common, the games with the cards are normally to find the similar object as fast as possible.</p>
            <p>After that they start leaving, Chad's dad takes Timo, Sofe, and Fede to their house. Timo adds Eitoku to The <a href="groups.html#GS">Grass Starers</a> </p>
            <p>Fede tells Timo that there will be a paper airplane competition, an idea that Timo had suggested. Fede also has the idea to sneak a happy birthday to alex in all of his stuco anouncements although this never happened.</p>

            <p>Then they went to eat ice-cream, they planned a way to get to the japan event, but they did not find any way. Then it started raining and Lupi invited all to his house to stay.</p>
            <p>Lupi played chess against Timo while others talked. When the game finished, Lupi showed off his amazing animal toy collection that he had as a kid, he really likes animals and knows a lot about them.</p>

            <b>What happened that day</b>
            <p>The Saac team went to school and got changed, they started dunking on the hoops, Jeff normally doesn't allow poeple to dunk but he was not there. Then the Toro, which is the UAS mascot went, dunked a ball, and hit the griddy.</p>
            <p>After that they did the camino, a tradition where the SAAC team goes running through the main hall and everyone cheers and sends them away to Chile. Alex and Chad played ping pong one last Time before going to the Airport. Then they went to the bus, where they slept and played clash royale</p>
            <p>Once in the airport, Lupi almost lost his paspport stuff twice, once he just dropped it all while he was standing, the other time he gave his stuff to Chad, he forgot that he gave it to Chad, and Chada forgot Lupi gave it to him. Lupi bought a big bag of gummy bears, then they sat and ate lunch, where they saw a TV that glitched every time an old man appeared. Lupi and Chada played fall guys, and Chad won, even though Lupi is also really good.</p>
            <p>Then they got in the plane. In the plane Alex and Lupi watched Luca Cassoni and Luca Taccone play games in their phones, then they played chess, Lupi won the first game of chess, and they tied the second one. Then Alex fell asleep and Lupi got photos of him which were terrible. Eitoku had brought a mask and glasses to completely cover his face.</p>

            <p>Then they went to dunkin donuts where Eitoku and Alex almost got scammed. Then they had to carry the luggagee with T-Shirts and other volleyball stuff, but it was so big that the wheels didn't work, so they had to drag it the entire way to the bus. ONce in the bus, they went to school.</p>
            <p>Alex went to meet his host, then they played volleyball, watched a movie, and ate dinner.</p>

            <p>They went to a pokestop at a nearby shop and they tried going to a gym but there was a fence that prevented them from getting there. On the way back, Sebas talked to Timo about werewolfs. Sebs was confused as to why would anyone ever want to be a werewolf. He had garlic in his pocket in case of a vampire attack. They started seeing who was the most likely to be a vampire, Timo also showed Sebas a cool song by The Cuartet of Us. Sebas also tells Timo that Dani texted him asking how he knew about the sweater being in the haunted house. Dani being confused is exactly what Timo and Sebas wanted.</p>
            <p>When they got to Timo's house, everyone took tests about their sexuality, turns out that according to the tests, Fede is the most straight person there. </p>
            <p> After that, they decided to go to the ritual, however the place was completely overhauled since the abandoned neighbourhood was being rebuilt. They still took some cool pictures though.</p>

            <p>Chiara invited people to her house. Timo convinced Sebas to go there. Many people where playing billiards and Chiara did not like that since she wanted to know everyons secrets by playing games like truth or dare.</p>
            <p>Sebas tries out vape, and he hated it. Suddenly Chiara enters the billiards room, and she says that anyone that misses has to take a shot, but no one does it. After a while, Chiara forces everyone to sit and play a game that Mati invented, a game in which someone asks a question, and if they don't answer, they have to do a dare.</p>
            <p>Bruno gave Sebas a speach about LSD's and drugs, and, THE BEINGS. Bruno gives a very detailed explanation on what the Beings are.</p>
            <p>Many questions were answered, but no question was really that revealing or interesting, until Dani's turn came and Timo asked the question.</p>

            <p>Which was the obvious, but still strange answer. Turns out that this wasn't the full reason, but that will be revealed in the future.</p>
            <p>Also, Fede officially revealed that he is in fact gay. In case there was any doubt before.</p>
            <p>After that, Chiara wanted to play spin the bottle, but then regretted it realising she might actually have to kiss someone.</p>
            <p>Chiara's back hurts but Bruno knows how to give massagess. Bruno has some chiropractical knowledge that he obtained from somewhere, so people often ask him for massages.</p>
            <p> After that, people got bored because no one had any interesting secrets that they were willing to tell, so people started playing billiards again. Then Martina comes, having missed everyone's secrets, she immediately starts drinking and then gets tired.</p>

            <b>24/11/2022</b>
            <p>Eitoku, Sebas, and Timo go to Alex's house to watch the football game of Uruguay vs Korea, and it was a 0-0 tie, very anti-climactic. Timo and Sebas routed for Uruguay, while Eitoku and ALex routed for Korea. Martina (who is in quatar) said that the match was very exciting, everyone begs to differ, but then they remember a ToK class in which there was a question "Who has more information about the concert, the one who attended the concert, or the one listening to it at home." Most answered that the one at the concert could aquire more information and thus he knew more. Therefore, Martina may have been right.</p>
            <p>After the surprisingly boring match, they played football, Alex and Eitoku vs Timo and Sebas, and they tied 4-4 and they were all exhausted from the heat. Alex has the idea to try to play skylanders, and after a lot of searching, he finds everything, except the cables needed to connect the console to the TV. Then they played a game of plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare. They made teams, Timo and Alex vs Sebas and Eitoku, the team that got the least amount of kills in three rounds had to run ten laps around Alex's yard. Alex and Timo started off winning, but Eitoku and Sebas pulled off an amazing 20 kill round, and Timo and ALex had to run in the heat of the sun.</p>
            <p>Then they went to eat pizza at a Domino's Pizza, everyone ordered peperoni toping, except Timo, who always orders olives. They ate the pizza at Alex's house, and it did not taste good at all, all pizza's tasted terrible, except Timo's for some reason.</p>
            <p>After the finnish eating pizza, the Sebas leaves and Eitoku, Alex, and Timo play ping pong, after that, Alex has an amazing idea, he grabs badmington rackets, and tries to find a birdy while Eitoku and Timo play ping pong. Alex fails to find the birdy.</p>
            <p>Alex improvises, and uses a ping pong ball instead of a birdy, it's terrible, and insanely hard to hit and aim, but they mannage to do several passes, until the ball ends up on a tree. They try to shake the tree, then they try to jump to the branch using a chair, but the chair sinks to the ground when they jump off of it, they tried many other ways to reach the ball, but all ways failed, and at the end, they never managed to get it out.</p>

            <p>Martina also watches the football match, but she is in quatar watching it, she also meets up with Vale afterwards.</p>

            <p>Fede's pet hedgehog defecated on Alex, and then Sofe arrived. After that, Alex cleaned his hand, they started to put the Wakanda Forever, but the quality was too bad. Sofe suggested that they should watch bullet train instead. </p>
            <p>The movie was about several illegal groups that were all lured to a train by someone called the white death. Everyone on that train did something that resulted on white death's wife to die and thus the white death's plan was to make everyone kill each other. The white death's daughter is on the train, she almost killed a father's son in order to lure into the train and try to force him to kill the white death (She hates her dad) However the father's father (The elder) arrives, and it turns out he knows the white death and he has been plotting for revenge for a long time. Also, the guy who killed the white death's wife was sick so the main character subs for him, meaning that he just got completely unlucky. There is also a guy that keeps talking about Thomas the Tank Engine and he is really cool. It ends with a de-railed train, the white death family died. And the main character learned a lesson about fate.</p>

            <p>Dani and Timo talk about sounds and music, then Lucas joins in, and they talk about many things. Among them, Lucas realises that everyone almost never calls him by his name, instead, everyone calls him Mono. Dani and Timo then talk about how people.</p>

            <p>The Math Finals for AI, AA, and AA HL are given out.</p>
            <p>In break time, Alex has a 9-1 lead against Timo, it's not looking good for Timo, but the match ends with Timo winning 12-10.</p>
            <p>The class then the ToK exam, but it wasn't really an exam, it was an assigment in which students had to create a summary of the sources they had gathered that where related to the extended essay topic. The class started with many people asking several questions to Mr Turner, some of the questions where really dumb and obvious, the class spent 45 minutes asking questions to Mr Turner. Mr Turner explains all of the questions getting more irritated per question</p>
            <p>The Math HL class gets their grades back, and Alex and Chad celebrate, but Dani wants to look at them after he is done with the ToK assigment. Chiara has a chair that makes noise and has cracks around it, so she she asks for a chair without cracks in it, but she frased it in a way that was really funny, and everyone lauphed. All the chairs had cracks, so Timo gave her the theatre chair so she would go back. Mr Turner thought that Chiara was looking for comfort, so he said that comfort makes people inneficient, Fede disagreed and Mr Turner used as evidence, the "einstein chairs". It is the type of chairs that the school uses, they are designed in the most efficiently uncomfortable way possible, so that students are always uncomfortable and always alert and concentrated.</p>
            <p>Fede still doesn't agree.</p>
            <p>Later in the day, Fabri, Timo, and Lucas study for Chemistry Exam the next day</p>
            <p>Timo then closes all tabs in his computer, accidentally closing one that had the recording of the ToK final class, he regrets not having saved it.</p>

            <b>Chemistry final</b>
            <p>A simple but long chemistry test</p>
            <b>Physics and Biology</b>
            <p>A very arduous test for both, apparently the physics one was meant to be easier though.</p>
            <h2>WWC and the the end</h2>
            <p>The WWC had plans to go to pocitoes and drink ice-cream and walk around and do stuff. Ethan gets to the bus that takes him to pocitoes in time, Timo missed the bud since he had some questions about the final, his mom drove him over, but he closed the trunk of the car onto his finger and had to go to the hospital and got 7 stitches.</p>
            <b>Sofe's Summary of WWC event</b>
            <p>We went to Seba’s house to leave our bags, then we walked to Ethan’s house and we then went to Mercado Williman, we had lunch there and then we went to las delicias for some ice cream, then we went back to Seba’s and then everyone went home and Fede and I took the bus home. </p>
            <p>Sofe also made a video of theWWC event.</p>
