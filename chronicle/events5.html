      <h2>Impending Sudden Times</h2>
      <b>Description</b>
      <p>Classes are starting once again. Something new that started happening is AI stuff, ChatGPT and other AI's are starting to become very important and popular. ChatGPT can write entire essays in seconds. For obvious reasons, many students appreciate the creation of ChatGPT. Apart from the technology, there was something in the news about China sending spy balloons to the US, and also UFOs in Canada and the US. People are worried that technology is evolving fast.</p>
      <p>People think that we are in the middle of a technological exponential curve. Paradigm shifts.</p>

          <b>02/02/2023</b>
          <p>The first day of class, in English class, everyone talks about their vacations, Chiara talks about her time in Punta del Este, Dani talks about how he visited the Mamone family(Ito Mamone is a graduate from UAS) and went to the US for the first time, and Martina talked about how her trip to Japan was very amazing and how she is willing to go study there.</p>
          <p>Then Mosckovicks talks about her cats, she also reveals that she is fighting to keep the two classes (Language and Literature) seperate. Then a review of authorial choices starts.</p>
          <p>In the break, Alex, Eitoku, Chad, Toby Liberman, and others play ping pong for the first time in ages. Some paddles where very different and it took time for people to adjust.</p>
          <p>In Digital society, everyone just talks about the vacations again, everyone repeats everything that they said in English.</p>
          <p>Later that day Dani, San, Mati, and Lucas where on call.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Eitoku also brought gifts for everyone, and he shared them in Math Class, he gave Timo a Tenugui with owls and hearts and a lucky 4-leafed clover pendant, and he gave the rest some snacks.</p>
          <p>During Spanish class, Sylvia greets everyone and she anounces that this will be the chapter where everyone will record their spanish individual oral. Normally the IAs, Extended Essays, and orals are done and turned in the second IB year. But Sylvia always prefers to get the official IB orals out of the way quickly in the first IB year so that they have more time in the senior year where the workload is huge.</p>
          <p>Sylvia tells everyone to start preparing their Oral</p>
          <p>Also, <a href="#">Alejandro</a> joins the WWC and he is added to the groupchat. He is a underclassman from the UAS class of 2023. Everyone likes him he is pretty cool and chill.</p>

            <p>The class had an advisory where Turner reminded them about CAS, they also had an introduction assembly.</p>
            <b>03/02/2023</b>
            <p>Before Chiara's party, Lucas reveals to Timo that he does not like going to parties with alcohol and loud music. Timo doesn't like this either, he is very bothered by loud music. Timo decided to still go to Chiara's party thing because of his philosophy of "Doing something is better than doing nothing". This was a mistake.</p>

              <p class="itg">Chill times before chaos)</p>
            </div>
            <p>At first, everything was chill, only the people from the UAS Class of 2024 was there. Mili, Mati, Martina, Dani, Angeles, and San where there, then Timo, Luca, and Lucas arrived. THen more and more people started arriving, people that no one recognised, Chiara experienced firsthand the consequences of allowing strangers into her party.</p>
            <p>Bruno came along, and he talked with Timo about drugs, psychology, pathology, science, the universe, conciousness, and much more. Bruno has had friends in past schools, some of them did drugs, some of them where victims of others, and one of them was is the worst person you will here about in this website. Bruno aslo helped several psychologicaly affected victims to recover from evil people.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile at Chiara's fences, people where trying to get in, some actually got in without even paying. Chiara had a guard that got mad when people got close to the entrance. Lupi, Dani, and Martina went to investigate what was happening. At this moment, Chiara promoted Angie and Martina to gatekeepers. Before that Chiara was talking to Lupi and Dani about cigarretes.</p>
            <p>Bruno started talking to Nico and Toby about drugs. Bruno knows A LOT about drugs and where to get them, he even had to pick up some drugs that where delivered to him to a house he no longer lived in or something like that, he had orderd them through the black market (according to him). Nico and Toby showed interest in drugs, this is the start of a friendship between Nico, Toby, and Bruno.</p>
            <p> Then some guys that where super drunk approached Bruno and Timo, they started to talk about football, then they destroyed Bruno and Timo at imaginary truco. Then the guys started talking about drugs and how the people from UAS must have never heard of the words "Crystal Meth" in their lives(cause UAS is the rich school), Bruno proceeds to prove them very wrong and he gives them a meth dealer contact.</p>
            <p>Angie and Martin Stein where at the door. Lupi, Luca, and Dani where chatting near the pool, they mentioned how funny it was that there was a couple that had been making out for 3 hours straight. Salma joins them and explains how they did not plan for so many people to get here, Chiara's house was full of people that no one knew, and many hadn't even payed, this was a total disaster. Eveyone left slowly but safely to their homes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Also in the other side of the world, Megan visits a World War 2 Museum and she changes her pfp to her with a bomb. She also sends the following pictures through the TTG groupchat</p>

          <p>Eitoku gets sick and he misses this day. This is the first day of STUCO, so STUCO plans various events for the year. I unfortunately failed to pay attention to what events they were talking about today.</p>

          <b>Advisory 10/02/2023</b>
          <p>This advisory, the class whatched a video about what makes a person happy throughout life. There was a study done, the study lasted a lifetime and it basically monitored a person's happiness throughout their life. The conclusion is that relationships such as friendships and love are what keeps people afloat.</p>
          <p>After the video ended, Martina brought up that the study was only done on men, and then some gender debate happened for like 2 seconds until the bell rung and everyone immediately left. Although Martina brings up a good point saying that the study excludes women, I think it's safe to say that the main conclusion for women must be similar to the conclusion for men, relationships are important since humans are social beings. Thats my opinion anyways.</p>
          <p>Eitoku missed english class today. But he surprised Alex and Chad with his presence at the ping pong tables during break. Turns out Eitoku simply missed the bus</p>

          <b>10/02/2023</b>
          <p>Timo had recently moved to a new house, so when Timo gets home from school, he explores the surrounding area, he ends up at some interesting place that he later finds out was private property.</p>

          <b>13/02/2023</b>
          <p>Mr Turner tells the class that they should revolt against the usage of phones in the school because they are dampening learning. Then he dedicates the entire class to explaining how society has led people to become more sensitive to psychological damage. He mentions the book "The Coddling of the American Mind" by Jonathan Haidt.</p>
          <p>Also <a href="others.html#vale">Vale</a> came to school to visit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>14/02/2023</b>
          <p>Director Murphy calls upon Timo, Luca, Dani, and Lupi to make a website as a CAS project for SAAC STEAM, STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, arts, and math. They were asked if they could create a website for the SAAC STEAM, still not sure what SAAC STEAM does.</p>
          <p>Mr Turner gets angry with the class because no one completes the journal entries.</p>
          <p>Megan posts something with a <a href="events3.html#trajectory">Mr Williams' quote</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>15/02/2023</b>
          <p>Mr Turner obliterated the journal entries and he overhauled the grading system. The previous grading system involved grading all entry journals and all assigments equally, however Mr Turner realised that people often did not do the entry journals, so to avoid bad grades, Mr Turner decided not to grade journal entries. The B Day ToK class didn't like this but the A-Day Class was okay with it</p>
          <p>The other class also didn't get to hear the entire change, because they were too upset about the changes. The proffesionalism grade was also removed and added into tests. Professionalism was removed because the people in the other ToK class were very unporffesional, they would always be on their phones and the commonly arrived late.</p>
          <p>Mr Turner explained that he was moving from a more Extrinsic Motivation Educational System to a more Intinsic Motivation Educational System. Basically the desire to learn must come from the student and not from punishments via the proffesionalism grade and the uncompleted journal entries.

          <p>Ping pong matches are played, and in lunch, Timo and Eitoku eating lunch beyond lunch time, luckily there was a fire drill so the class couldn't learn much because of the distraction, meaning that they didn't miss much. After school ended, San, Eitoku, Timo, and Chad play Ping Pong until basketball starts.</p>
          <p>After all that, there is a wine and cheese event, an event that is for parents to meet other parents, and eat and drink cheese, wine, and other stuff. Lucas studies for the Chemistry test tomorrow, Eitoku sees a building with a flare, and Timo eats ice-cream, while others are probably out there doing even more interesting things that I don't know about.</p>

The presentation can be anything except a slide show, meaning that the students will have to get creative. Mr Turner tells a tale of a time where a student did a presentation with a dance. Some people made videos, others made games, but most people ended up doing infographics or something similar.</p>

            <p>The WWC does a surprise birthday party to Timo.</p>
            <p>Timo was coming back from a walk. Alex, Eitoku, Fede, Sofe, and Ethan surprise Timo when he come back, everything had been planned by Fede. Sofe gave Timo a sketchbook and some bird cards and Fede gave timo 5 Dimensional Chess with Multiverse Time Travel. Timo showed them around the house while Chad, Lupi, and the others arrived.</p>
            <p>After all of the <a href="groups.html#WWC">WWC</a> showed up, they hanged out on Timo's room, until they decided to go back to the backyard, where Sofe was showing Timo some photos of the stars, Timo showed Sebas some random photos, one of which had an interesting shadow effect due to some interesting light phenomena with trees. Sebas was curious about the shadows, and Timo told him that they could go visit them.</p>

            <p>Whil that was happening, Lupi was learning how to go on the EWheel, and he learned really fast.</p>
            <p>They all went to "See the shadows" although only Sebas new what that meant. Timo brought the Caster Board, and Lupi brought the Ewheel. Ethan, Sofe, and Lupi tried out the Ewheel. Ethan was really struggling with the Caster Board and Timo took it back eventually.</p>
            <p>They arrived at the shadows, and they played hide and seek. To chose the seeker they played "Black and White" a game where you put hand up or hands down and the odd one out is the seeker. Lucas and Eitoku where chosen. The teams where, Timo and Sofe; Alex and Chad; Sebas, Ethan and Lupi, however Lupi, Sebas, and Chad didn't get together, the only person that lost was Sebas since he was the only one to get caught before reaching home base. Also Riho and Leo came to the party.</p>
            <p>Timo tried teaching Sofe how to hand whistle, and he almost succeeded. Eitoku then had to leave :(</p>
            <p>After that they all went back to Timo's house, where they played a game called "Limones", a rythm game where you have to keep the rythm while saying your number of lemons, half a lemon, and another persons amount of lemons. Everyone but Chad, Fede, Timo, and Sofe where struggling a lot to say it, so they gave up.</p>

After that they played telephone, but everyone also forgot to try in this game. They proceeded with a final round of pictionary pictionary, it was boys+Sofe against girls+timo, and the girls won.</p>
          <p>The class also had their first Math IA session, where they discuss the IA rubric, and how examiners are always pissed (Mr Lopez is an examiner).</p>

            <p>Alex, Timo, Luca Taccone, Fede, Carol, and Kaila go to volleyball practice and the do volleyball things. They ended the practice playing two games which was cool.</p>
            <p>Later that day, Timo goes for a walk and encounters Martina in her mothers car, they said hi to each other and moved on.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Timo's Celebration</h2>
            <p>Timo's birthday was a week ago, but he didn't celebrate it because it was in carnaval, so he celebrated it a week after, he celebrated it in Solimar's Lon tennis, which is a huge place with a barbacue, a playground, and a football field. Fabrizzio was the first to arrive, he arrived while Timo was making wakamole, the party technically started at 19:30, but everyone came at 20:00, except Fabrizzio, and Sofe, she arrived too.</p>
            <p>After Timo was done with the guacamole, Sofe and Timo played a bit of volleyball, and they discussed weather or not Sofe should join the volleyball team, she says she will only join the saturday because she does not like segregation between boys and girls in sports. Then Sofe had the chance to try the <a href="events4.html#fanta">mystery fanta</a> and to no one's surprise she hated it, Fabri tried it out too and he also thought it was terrible. Timo then said "I wish Fede was here" and in that very second, Fede calls him saying that he has arrived with the rest of the WWC( Except Lucas who couldn't come because of Tennis reasons) After that, Martina, Angie, Salma, Milagros, and Chiara came together. They all devoured the guacamole very quickly, Mili said it was really good. Milagros calls Dani, but Dani reveals he is not coming because he is extremely sick :(</p>
            <p>Sofe, Fabri, and Mili then tried the second mystery flavour fanta, which was better than the first one but still really bad. Sofe realised that Chad and Alex went missing, Timo and Sofe went to search for them. Turns out they just went for a walk since the place was big. Then Luca cassoni arrives to the party. Luca, Mati, Martina, <a href="others.html#pauli">Pauli</a>, and Timo play volleyball, then Chiara joins for 2 seconds and then leaves since she is not good. Some people then got to the play ground, which has some swings, seasaws, and a little wooden structure with a bridge. Most of the WWC was playing football, they decided to do a mundialito and many people joined.</p>
            <p>They played for a while until the burgers were done and everyone went to eat. Lupi arrived and he gave a book to Timo about very absurd answers to absurd questions, in this moment, Eitoku gave Timo another gift, a bookmark. Lupi and Eitoku remarked how their gifts fit well with each other even though they didn't plan it. This is when this picture of Eitoku was taken, try to spot him.</p>

            <p>They all ate burgers and Chips, Timo also made Alex and Chad try the mystery Fanta, however, Sebas had made them try it before so it wasn't their first rodeo. But their tastebuds are not working properly because they taste all the fanta's the same and they said it was a "mid" flavour. Also, Pauli invited some friends of hers, Riho, Pame, and Leo where there. Alex, Chad, and Fede go for a walk, leaving Sofe, Timo, and Eitoku behind, then until Eitoku left too. So the remaining pair went in search for everyone. They found Alex, Chad, and Fede near some trees, and then a branch fell on Timo, then everyone started hearing rustling in the trees, they look up and there is something above them in the trees. A voice is heard... "I AM THE LORAX!!", Lupi reveals himself to be the one who speaks for the trees.</p>
            <div class="img si30">

            </div>
            <p>They talk about history assigments in some benches next to a football field until they get bored and Chad, Lupi and Alex got to play football. Martina, Chiara, Salma, Mili, Timo, Eitoku, and Sofe stay in the bench watching the rest play. Martina is playing an anime rythm game in her ipad.</p>
            <p>Then Sofe Left and Timo joined the soccer game, Eitoku followed. They were playing whoever scores a goal becomes the goaly. Lupi adopts a more defensive and passive strategy where he avoids the enemy. Eitoku approaches Lupi but Lupi responds by going back, then Eitoku approaches him again, and Lupi goes further back. They end up going incredibly far from the goal, so Timo ran up to them to stop this. Lupi uses Timo as a distraction to make a run for the goal while Eitoku is distracted, however Timo takes the ball from him. Now it's a race of Eitoku vs Timo racing towards the goal while fighting for the ball. They get all the way back to the goal but Luca Cassoni joins the game, steals the ball , and scores.</p>
            <p>They played football for a while longer, until Timo decided it was time for cake, so he summoned everyone back to the barbacue, and he told his sister to light the cake, but he noticed that Eitoku, and Fede where outside, so he went to get them, but unbeknownst to him, the candles where already lit and everyone was singing happy birthday, when he arrived, the candle ran out of fire, and so they did a take 2 of the birthday song, this time with everyone present</p>
            <p>Then Timo brought ice-cream, which absolutely no one except Fede and Timo ate. Timo, then talked to Martina about their encounter earlier today. Then, Angie started talking about jobs, asking everyone what they wanted to be, Eitoku said he wanted to be a lawyer. Eitoku, Martina, Mati, and Chiara then left, and the rest continued talking. Fede talked to Timo about some stuff, like the different chapters that have happened, and also how Chad and Alex didn't think the mystery fanta was an that bad. Mili and Fede start shouting at them for not completely disliking the fanta, Mili had tried it too. Timo decided to follow Eitoku, and they went to the playground, where Chiara was teaching Mati some cheerleading moves, and Mati was just mixing it up with gymnastics, while Timo, Eitoku, and Martina talked about things like gymnastics, CAS, and more. Timo told a tale of how Lupi, when he was a new student, peed on the school bushes instead of going to the bathroom and to this day he doesn't know why.</p>
            <p>Then they tried out piggy back riding, where Timo told another tale, Ayla Baker once won a 3 tier chicken fight. Then they went to the swings and the seasaws, and they talked about random things, until Mati and Chiara started a dance off, the dance off was the most intense thing that happened in this entire day, the moves were nearing perfection, Eitoku, Martina and Timo were the judges, but it was immposible to decide who won.</p>
            <p>Then Lupi and Luca came, and they played on the seasaw. Then they climbed the wooden playhouse where Chiara declared herself the queesn of the playground and started saying a bunch of rules. Also Martina was trying to "Eck" Lupinacci... whatever that meant. Timo asked but Chiara responded saying "You don't want to know", here is a video of some of the rules.</p>

          <p>In Math AI class, Chiara and Sebas do the CheckUp Quiz race, but this time they bet a chocolate milk. Sebas finished first, but they agreed that getting more answers correctly was more important than finishing faster. Last class, they had learned Sigma notation, but in this quiz, there was no use of the Sigma notation, Mr Zarsky did this on purpose to test the students if they knew when to use Sigma notation and when not to.</p>
          <p>Sebas finished first, but he used Sigma notation when he should have just simplified a sequence using the arithmetic sequence formula, so despite Chiara being slower, she won because she did it right, so Sebas gave her a Colet.</p>

          <p>Salma invited the class to her house, Bruno, Mati, Fabri, San, Luca, Timo, Lupi, Mili, and Martina went to her house. At some point, Bruno gave Salma and other people his special vape. But they weren't strong enouph to withstand Bruno's vape and they started to feel really bad, so the event ended quickly. Also San stole Mili's vape and she got mad because she can't be away from it from more than 10 minutes</p>

          <p>Also, Milla asks Eitoku and Timo for a room tour. Eitoku is unsure on what to call Milla, Milla explains that she always tries to make everyone call her Millis but everyone ends up calling her Milla eventually. Sebas points out that Millis is the opposite of a nickname since it makes the name longer rather than shorter. Milla likes the name "Millis" because it has been with her ever since she was 4.</p>

          <p>There is an assembly where there are several lipsync battles. The candidates where chosen by STUCO representatives. But here are the important candidates</p>
          <b>Carol vs Lara</b>
          <p>Any matchup against Lara is unfair since she is the leader of the UAS drama club and OPHELIAS, she does musicals often. She came prepared with an umbrella to lipsync to the song, Umbrella, and lipstick and with a partially unbuttoned charvet shirt. Carol go destroyed.</p>
          <b>Dani vs Bruno(SENIOR)</b>
          <p>This is the real battle, Bruno was not convinced of going, but the crowd convinced him, Dani was not convinced either, but he was dragged by Bruno, they lipsynced to baby shark, Dani basically copied Bruno, and thus he lost.</p>

          <p>Chad does not know Spanish that well, and the song was Despacito, however he put more effort than Nicole and thus he won.</p>
          <b>Luca Taccone and someone else</b>
          <p>Someone and Renzo were chosen, but Renzo refused to go, not even the crowd could convince him, so after a while, Luca Taccone decided to volunteer himself and save the day, they sang together, not as a competition, Country Road, and the Stuco officers(who where the judges all this time) declared it was a tie.</p>
          <b>Teachers</b>

              <p>The English class is about to start, but Mr Murphy is there standing omninously. After everyone is seated, he proceeds to explain that Eitoku was involved in some undisclosed accident that resulted in him ending up in the hospital. He is alive but it's unkown if he'll make it. Murphy also says that he is aware that some people knew about this already, from the looks of it Alex and Sebs. Martina and Chiara weren't there so they missed the news if they didn't know already.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Pie Day</h2>
            <p>So several teachers get pied in the face, Mr Amaral, Mr, Mr Granger, Mr Davidson, Mr Rodrigo, and Mr Williams. While this is happening, Fede is crying in the bathroom about the news of Eitoku, but he has to bottle it up because the rest of the day is waiting for him</p>
            <p>Alex, Eitoku, and others have a study hall at the same time as the Digital Society class is happening. However Eitoku is not present so Alex is alone in the study hall. He decides to unofficially join the Digital Society course. In Digital Society, Javi reveals that he knows that Eitoku fell of his balcony. Eitoku's apartment is not that close to the ground, it's 5 stories up so that's pretty worrying. Also apparently Chiara went to check up on him in the british hospital which is perhaps the reason she isn't here today.</p>
            <i>[PS] this is all just stuff I heard, it could all be wrong but nothing sounds unbelievable</i>
            <p>Alex learns about using Microsoft Access to create databases. He actually participate more in the class than the people that actually take Digital Society which Javi finds pretty funny.Alex talks with Lupi throughout most of the class.</p>
            <p>During Math class, <a href="others.html#jasmine">Jasmine</a> appears. She's apparently a visitor whose grandma worked at UAS a long time ago. She joins the Wander Warbler's Contingent for a little while.</p>

          <p>Some part of the class goes to a field trip to the Catholic University of Uruguay (Universidad Catolica del Uruguay [UCU]), they went to the bus after 25 minutes of the second period.</p>
          <b>The ones who went to UCU</b>

          </ul>
          <p>They entered the main building while a big amount of UCU students were leaving the main building so it was quite messy. Then they went to the UCU equivalent of the flexible workspaces at UAS. They sa a video with information and the students were later tested on this information. Nikki and Mili won bottles because they payed attention</p>
          <p>Then they were split into groups according to what they wanted to be when they grew up, and whoever didn't know, went to a group where they just learned more about the university, this group was told that the university had ping pong tables.</p>

On the way there, they saw how UCU had colonised an entire area with their buildings. The class passed 4 other UCU building before arriving to the audiovisual studio.</p>
          <p>Food was waiting them in the audiovisual room, some tiny sandwiches of chicken, some with jam and cheese, and some with meat, they were actually pretty good, there was also coke there.</p>
          <p>They went to see the photography and design section. There was a lso a studio for film with audio equipment and stuff. There was a smaller version of the film room and also a podcast room</p>

          <p>After that, they came back to school, and it rained, it rained a lot, Timo remarked that if it rained while they were walking back, the story would have been more interesting. Sebs asks if Timo has ever lied to make a story more interesting, Timo replied that he has done this sometimes, but weather or not a story is interesting is also highly dependant on the way it's told. Then he tells the story of how they went to UCU in a really interesting way which Sebas found funny since he found the experience pretty boring.</p>
          <b>Info on Eitoku</b>
          <p>Now we know a bit more thanks to some sources, Eitoku's mom flew all the way from Japan to here, Eitoku is in an induced comma, he fell of the Balcony, and soon, they will stop inducing the comma and see how he is, if he is fine, then they will begin fixing his broken body.</p>
          <p>Also, Megan tells a story about her group in greensboro</p>

            <b>Megan's story</b>
            <p>Me, Ben, Sammie, and Isaiah went to McDonald’s after some of that alleged illegal stuff</p>
            <p>And we were waiting for food and we were trying to decide what we we’re going to do after we ate</p>
            <p>And they obviously tried to make me decide what we were doing bc I was group leader</p>
            <p>And bc I was so indecisive I couldn’t decide</p>
            <p>But they expected an answer from me</p>
            <p>And they started to pressure me and where like ur group leader so u need to decide this</p>
            <p>And I was freaking out and I couldn’t decide I told them I didn’t know and then Ben mentioned that he should be group
              leader and he said he would be better at making decisions</p>
            <p>And Sammie was like no u can’t let him do that</p>
            <p>Isaiah was agreeing with Ben</p>
            <p>I was so confused and stressed that I was starting to consider it</p>
            <p>And Ben just kept pressuring me and I finally gave in and unfortunately I am no longer group leader</p>
            <p>I shook his hand and I officially transferred leadership to Ben</p>
            <p>In conclusion he hasn’t done anything with his new power yet</p>
            <p>But today I asked him what it was like to be the leader and he said it hadn’t sunk in yet</p>
            <p>And that he was going to start being more strict and rule with an iron fist</p>
            <p>And he said something about communism</p>
            <p>And I really like the idea of communism but I felt Julia needed to be segregated</p>
            <p>Bc she was a year younger then us</p>
            <p>And he agreed wich made me really happy</p>
            <p>He agreed so much that he elected me to be vice president</p>
            <p>I am really happy to have this role in office</p>

          <p id="hashmap">Another Normal day, except that at the first break, some art students prepare a art exhibit. In Digital Society, Timo asked Sebas what a Hashbrown was, Sebas was about to respond but Dani was near them and he misheard the question. Dani proceeded to give a very detailed explanation of what a Hashmap is(HashMAPs are like a hacking thing I don't actuall know), and Sebas found it hilarious.</p>
          <p> Then at lunch, Ms Tendai the elementary art teacher kicks everyone from the ping pong tables, Alex, Chad, and Timo are flabberghasted. Mati, San, and Fabri also went to play, and got kicked, and they were also flabberghasted. This happened because Tendai had the amazing idea of hanging kid's drawing from the bridge on top of the ping pong tables.</p>
          <p>STUCO makes posters for the next coffee house. Also lunch today is really good, they made jacked potatoes, with toppings, so one could choose what to put them, very deluxe. At recess the WWC, which Alejandro has recently joined, wants to get to know better Jasmine, so they are organising to go to Punta Carretas mall.</p>
          <p>Fede and Timo decide to do a "Contrapunto"(a sophisticated rap battle in spanish) against ChatGPT, and they proposed it to Sylvia the spanish teacher, since it has a lot to do with literary devices such as rhymes. <p>
          </p> At the end of the class Mr Murphy informs the class about Eitoku's mom's arrival to Uruguay, and that Eitoku is in an induced comma, confirming the rumours about him being in an induced comma. Murphy often gives updates abou Eitoku's situation, even when he has no new information.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Fede and Timo talk about how the WWC groupchat is barely used anymore. They also talk about how the group has been divided since Ethan, Sofe, Bruno, and Alejandro Richeri hang out seperately from the rest.</p>

            <p>Fede promised Sebas that he would get a Beanie for Sebas, it was a birthday gift that Fede owed to Sebas. Timo got a beanie to ruin Fede's chance of getting it first. In Timo's defense, Fede took a long time to get him a beanie, but Fede argued that he couldn't find a beanie anywehere.</p>

            <p>In the beach, they run into a box, with a gum stuck on it. They admire the ocean, and the sand, and then Lupi goes to do his buisness in some bushes while Alex and Chad analyse his efficiency. Lupi finds some candles and steals them from the floor, he gives them to Alex, then Ale leaves, then the people that are left (Alex, Chad, Timo, and Fede) sit on the floor. Alex gives Timo the candles and Lupi communicates with some ants.</p>
            <p>Then they went to Lupi's house and played basketball.</p>

          <b>22/03/2023</b>
          <h3>Eitoku you made Valentina Manzo talk to us for the first time in years I will never forgive you for this you bitch</h3>
          <p>In period 2B, all the class is brought outside of the school by Valentina Manzo and Michelle Werlin. Michelle and Valentina procceed to give out an incredibly long talk about how they know how hard the situation has been for them and how they are willing to assist anyone psychologically. Then they tried to get people to express how they felt about Eitoku's situation, obviously no one said a word so it was kind of uncomfortable. No one really believes that Valentina Manzo and Michelle Werling are good counselors.</p>
          <p>The counselors propose to talk in smaller groups. So people start talking in smaller groups. The <a href="others.html#WWC">WWC</a> expressed their feeling about Eitoku, essentially they are sad, and Lupi doesn't really want to talk about it. Timo reveals that he has been sending Eitoku summaries of all the days since it's the only way he could help Eitoku in the situation he is in. Fede said "That is such a Timo thing to do".</p>
          <p>Then they all start making posters that they will send to Eitoku, the class makes one with everyone's name in it, and Timo makes one that's only made by the WWC members. He told everyone to include some reference or an inside joke that Eitoku would understand. So the poster was filled with things like ping pong, volleyball, and little inside jokes. Lupi was the only one that didn't sign the poster, he didn't even want to sign the class poster. My guess is that he doesn't want to be a part of any of this sinc eit might be too much for him, but that's just my guess.</p>
          <p>In Math AI, Chiara managed to convince Zarsky to skip a math test arguing that everyone was too mentally exhausted with Eitoku's situation to take a test right now, so the entire class had study hall. Mr Baranzano arrived and he gave Timo a big stack of music sheets since tomorrow it's SAAC Fine Arts and he is a musician.</p>
          <p>In lunch time, Ale signs the WWC poster, but others also add  some drawings, Sebas, Ethan, Sofe, and Ale hear the story about how Timo created the website. They also say that in the lore, Sebs and Timo should actually be considered villains since they killed Martina, and Martina ws the hero.</p>
          <div style="height:30px;width:30px;" class="dropdowner border1">
            <div style="width:500px;padding:10px;" class="dropdowner-content">
              <p>Timo made this website in a History class which he hated because Foege was a bad teacher, so he called his first page hate.html, in that page he decided to make a theory that explained in a positive light, a reason to why Martina missed school so much. That is the <a href="hate.html#hero">SuperHero Theory</a> that you can still see to this day.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p> After that, in spanish class, Fede got a message from Timo's mother, since Timo lost his phone, the message said that the Tenugui was found and Timo celebrated.</p>
          <b>Camino</b>
          <p>The SAAC Fine Arts Camino took place, Fede, Ethan, Bruno, Sofe, Timo, and others, like Lara, Tasia, and Juanma went to the Camino, an event where they pass through the main hall with everyone cheering them.</p>

          <p>While they were waiting for Volleyball, Alex and Lupi are doing some work while Timo is playing chess against a kid. After Timo destroys a kid in chess, Lupi challenges him.</p>
          <p>Lupi starts off bad, blundering a knight, but then Timo blunders a bishop, and then Lupi blunders the queen and it was game over from then.</p>
          <p>Then Alex challenges Timo, it was a complex game at first, both parties had a very solid position and they were evenly matched until Alex blundered half of his pieces. Alex's position was focused on not letting a knight fork the king and the rook, but he put too much focus on that, causing him to lose the rest of his pieces. And then the king and the rook got forked anyways.</p>
          <p>Then they went to volleyball practice where they first practiced some spikes and sets, and then they played a match for the rest of the class.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After some more time, the class went to a missa where they prayed for Eitoku's future and well being. They chatted a little after that, and then they left. Constan Borit attended this missa despite not knowing who Eitoku is.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Megan informs the Table Tube Gang that Ben and Isaiah suffered from a car crash in which they were hit by a drunk driver. Isaiah got his back hurt, and Ben now drives his moms car. It seems that the Classes of 2024 are having issues all around.</p>

            <p>Sofe, Ethan, Juanma, and some others went to the freeshop and bought something, Sofe also went to the VIP section to see if they had chips, which they did not. Then they all went to eat some sandwiches at some near restaurant until they got called to the plane.</p>

            <p>After that, they arrived at Peru, and some people exchanged money, some others went to the bathroom, and everyon got their luggage, and so they went ofrward and outside the airport.</p>

            </div>
            <p>When they get outisde, they see a lot of billboard about Peru. They also see some FDR ambassadors wearing bright red shirts.</p>
            <p>They went to a bus, the heat was intense, some people had clothes beneath the SAAC required outfit, those people could take the outfit off, unfortunately for all others, they were stuck in the heat. The ambassadors of Roosvelt then handed out snacks and gifts, the gifts included a water bottle, a card that said who you were, what you were travelling for (Music, visual, etc)and some emergency contacts aswell as a schedules, and a SAAC FINE ARTS T-Shirt with a cool symbol.</p>
            <p>Bruno debated with Timo about the subjectivity of taste in food, since both tasted a lays bag that was made with peruvian potatoes, and it was clearly different taste, but Timo said it was the same. Timo argued that taste can be very objective, and that he is just bad at tasting, Bruno argued the opposite and he convinced Timo</p>
            <p>During the bus ride to FDR, the students of UAS admire the poor areas plagued with bad housing and little to no vegetation. They are all surprised when seeing the polluted landscape which contains a brown river filled with trash. The bill boards at the airport parking lot where covering this upsetting sight.</p>

            <p>The sky was blue, but also very smoggy. Eventually they get to the school of FDR. The school is surrounded by an enormous wall with security cameras and spikes. The wall prevents the students from seeing the how the school looks like. They enter through a big metal gate, and they see the see that the school of FDR is very pretty compared to the previous sights. The grass is much more green and there is a lot more vegetation overall.</p>

            <p>The students enter to the school, and it is absolutely huge, there a several busses, and the theatres are massive. They go on a tour where they get to see all the places, the school is much bigger than UAS, they have common rooms which is their equivalent of the flex space(except much bigger). Unlike UAS, they have more than one place where you can get your food from, you have like different options which is insane. They also have 6 ping pong tables, offices for students, meeting rooms, a pool, a big very big gym, and much more.</p>
            <p>Everyone is shocked at how big the place is, but after that, they went to the theatre, where Lara simply enjoyed the big theatre, at some point, the Drama teacher of the school (Ms Lin) came and told everyone that they could go to the shopping to do stuff</p>

              <p class="itg">In the theatre</p>
            </div>
            <p>Then they waited for a bus that was going to take them to the mall, they waited in the stage where Mr Turner and Domi where talking about extended essays, like Martina's initial research question "How was the universe created" and other things.</p>
            <p>Eventually the bus did come, and everyone went to the mall. On their way to it, Sofe was talking to Timo about some interesting things, when Timo tells her that Turner's dream Job is to open an Japanese restaurant(or something like that[It's a restaurant where a chef cooks the food in front of you and then serves it, there are also waiters who are ladies that are nice and attend you, basically a huge table where the chef is just having a great social time with the clients while cooking them food.]), and Sofe(wanting that dream to come true) starts proposing very smart and interesting ways to gain money, things that could actually work, and Turner is surprised to hear such good ideas. Sofe called these "Side Hustles"</p>
            <p>They get to the mall, and they go to an eating Area where everyone splits up and does their own thing, Fede went with Ines and Mili, aswell as an ambassador named Monica, while Ethan, Sofe, and Bruno went to popeyes and Lara went to Subway. They also find this monstruosity</p>
            <div class="img si27">
              <img src="new/22,3,2023/20230322_180941575_iOS.jpg" class="ing">
              <p class="itg">Crimes against humanity</p>
            </div>
            <p>Timo went to a random restaurant and got some steak with rice and spaghetti, he didn't find anyone anywhere. An ambassador noticed Timo who was very lost and she guides him to where the people are. Turns out that Sofe, Ethan, Bruno, Juanma, and Lara were sitting behind a Subway stand in the perfect angle so that Timo couldn't see them.</p>
            <p>After that, Sofe really wanted to try some Bobba tea since Uruguay doesn't really have those. All the group goes with her. There was a Bobba tea shop right next to the Subway where they were sat. However they used google maps, and google maps sent them on an entire odyssey across the mall. They went to ice-cream shops and stuff, all across the first floor and across the second floor. In the end they ended up right where they began, next to the bobba tea shop, and they all ask themselves how the hell did they not see it. So they drink bobba, Timo tries it for the first time.</p>
            <p>But on the way to the Bobba Tea Shop, Timo could get some ice-cream so it wasn't all for nothing. Also unlike Uruguay, each ice-cream flavour costs a different amount of money which is interesting. After bobba tea, Ethan and Bruno get a coffee at starbucks. Lara and Mili go to see some clothes, and after that, they all go to the bus and head back to shcool.</p>
            <p>After that, Sofe really wanted to try some Bobba tea since Uruguay doesn't really have those. All the group accompanies her. She tries using her phone to find a bobba tea shop. There was a bobba tea shop right next to where they ate, but they accidentally journeyed the entire mall only to return to the place where they ate, and only then, did they find the tea.I want to emphasize that they literally searched the entire mall for a bobba tea shop that was right next to them at the beginning. All floors of the mall were explored.</p>
            <p>Then Ethan and Bruno get coffee at Starbuck, Timo gets ice-cream, Lara and Mili go to see some clothes. And they all go back to school. In school, they go to a reserved common area for them, where Timo takes these funny pictures</p>

              <p class="itg">Sofe said that she doesn't look good on the first photo and Timo disagrees</p>
            </div>
            <p>After that, Turner discusses extended essay stuff with everyone around. He also discusses his grading system and he justifies some changes he made in respect with proffesionalism.</p>
            <p>Then they all go outside and the families are waiting there, before they leave they are told to wear the SAAC fine arts official T-Shirt for tommorrow because there will be a picture. All host families eventually pick up all the students until none are left. Timo gets this picture of Mr Turner to make a "Now that's CAS" sticker in Whatsapp</p>

            <p>They all arrive to the Franklin Delano Roosvelt schoo.. There is a lot of traffic in peru. Fede, Juanma, and Timo are staying at a house where the host has a daughter that has passed away and the mother just randomly revealed this fact right after meeting them which was kind of odd. The son also plays a lot of fortnite and he screams, Fede and Timo could hear the son sceaming in the other room and they found it hilarious.</p>
            <p>Anyways all of the Fine Art students arrive the the Roosvelt school, today the opening ceremony is happening. Ms Lyn does a speach, during her speach she would pause everytime she heard someone talking which was really funny. Then the superintendent of the school gives a speach about the importance of art. Then some artists do some cool art. There are some peruvian and mexican dances that happen.</p>
            <p>Also, the school gave everyone a SAAC Fine Arts 2023 T-Shirt. Timo was given a medium sized T-Shirt which didn't fit him. He asked for an XL and he luckily got the last one. So now he has 2 shirts. He plans to give one of the shirts to Eitoku so that everyone would think he somehow went to SAAC Fine Arts while being in a comma.s</p>
            <p>Then they all take a giant group picture.</p>

            <b>Theatre</b>
            <p>They must practice a play throughout the days and finaly present it in Satruday</p>
            <b>Music</b>
            <p>The Band group, the Choir group, and the Strings group will all practice songs and present them in Saturday.</p>
            <b>Visual</b>
            <p>They are in charge of bringing an art piece that they made previous to the SAAC Fine Arts event, they must make a presentation about said art piece and present the presentation at saturday. If you come with the presentation done then you have nothing to do.</p>
            <b>Media</b>
            <p>Media is in charge of going around all the other fine arts students and capturing the experience, they will then later edit the videos and present them in the presentation on saturday.</p>
            <p>Fede had his presentation already done, so he has a free day for the rest of the day. Timo was struggling at band since he did not study the music sheets because he was supposed to know by heart.</p>
            <p>Sofe and Bruno went around filming different sections, At some point Bruno filmed Timo, and Timo just played some random thing to look cool.</p>
            <p>Lara and Juanma practiced their play that their Drama teacher invented.</p>
            <p>After all of that, the entire Fine Arts team went to the auditorium for an assembly, in which a choir teacher taught them how to sing, and made them sing a song that they will be forced to sing in Saturday.</p>

            <b>Things to consider</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The auditorium is giant</li>
              <li>There is a Mobile Cafe Truck that is called Tony's Cafe, they have cookies, brownies, coffee, and other stuff to eat.</li>
              <li>There is a whole underground section that one can access by going back stage and the Media Film crew can use to take pictures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A bus arrived and the SAAC FINE ARTS students where given food. The food consisted of a sandwich, an apple, and Maracuya juice. Then everyone went to busses to go to a dessert museum called pachacamac. In the bus drive, the WWC members + Bruno talked about random things. Timo showed Ethan some songs by El Cuarteto De Nos, he also told Ethan about a time where he was on a tree.</p>
            <p>They got to the dessert, Ethan destroyed a bathroom because Timo was stuck inside a bathroom stall. Then all fine art students were divided intro groups, and a guide was assigned to them. They went and explored ruins of previous civilisations that had once ruled over the dessert. They learned about schools for women, that women where sacrificed, that priests got high on cactus juice to speak to gods, that merchants waited to go to the temple, that pachacamac was creator of earth, and that a woman was sneakily impregnated and she commit suicide along with her daughter.</p>
            <p>After that, they went inside the museum, where they drinked water and ate ice-cream, they got to see the representation of god himself, a carved log.</p>
            <p>They go to the bus, and on the way there, Sofe tells Timo that Fede hates her, Timo doubts this and he says that he will ask Fede if this is true. Then they came back to school, and eventually, their host families came to pick them up.</p>

So now every day before getting up, he checks his surroundings, then Timo an interesting quote "I know how deep a river is, only after I take a step in the water". Megan liked the quote and she says that she will use it some day in the future[May 19 2024].

            <p>The Fine Arts students were called to the upper common room. Timo tells Sofe why Fede treats her badly sometimes. It's because Fede said that she sometimes "Had too much energy and he wasn't feeling it." Sofe that its just the way she is and if Fede doesn't like it then they shouldn't be friends./p>
            <p>The Music players practiced, their music all day, the thespians practiced their plays all day. The visual artists made a mural outside the theatre, and the Media crew spent all day filming the artists.</p>
            <p>Timo joined the media crew since he did not play the songs that were currently being played, Bruno and Sofe interviewed him in a funny way and in a serious way.</p>
            <p>After that, they went to interview other people, they struggled to get Drama people interviews because they were so occupied. But eventually they got an interview with the UAS Drama section, were Lara talked about shirtless people and parkour.</p>

            <p>During lunch, Sofe tells everyone about her boyfriend Juampi. Apparently there was someone in the rugby team who was being mean to another. Juampi heroically punched the mean guy in the face, immediately knocking him out. Mr Turner was eating some sushi that he bought at the school. It's insane that you can just buy sushi at this school, it's insane how many food options this school offers this is so much better than Uruguayan American School.</p>
            <p>After that, everyone went to sing to the auditorium, all the SAAC Fine Arts body hates this part, no one likes to sing except the choir I guess.</p>
            <p>The students went out, celebrating that the singing was over. A Media Team drone filmed them from above. Sofe then talked to Timo about Fede. Fede had told Timo that Sofe was a little bit "too much" at times. Sofe really did not vibe with Fede at all. Sofe claimed that Fede was always mean to her despite the fact that she never did anything to him. Sofe decided that she simply won't be friends with Fede, arguing that  "You can't be liked by everybody" and that she has tried hard enouph.</p>
            <p>Then all the parents came to pick them up</p>

            <h2>The Day Everyone has been Waiting For</h2>
            <p>The day starts with all the SAAC Fine Arts students going to the common room that is upstairs in the lunch building, while in the common room, Ms Linn tells everyone that they must play a game, were they must organize themselves in terms of birthdays but without talking. The funny thing is that while Ms Lyn would wait for absolutely everyone to be silent while before she spoke, and if she heard any voices at all, she would stop talking. This basically resulted in her just suddenly halting her explanation every 10 seconds which was really funny since it looked like she just had a stroke every time.</p>
            <p>People are really dumb, and it takes them 10 minutes when a previous team that was larger had done it in 3</p>
            <p>After that, all of the Fine Arts students do their arts, the music students practiced 2 of the 4 songs that they would be presenting today, the Theatre group practiced their plays, the Media crew edited the videos and took some final photos and finally the visual arts group prepared the mural and curated the paintings that the students did.</p>
            <p>After that, there was a small break where several music members played a small football match. The break ended and everyone went back to their arts.</p>
            <p>The music members finished before everyone, and so they were free to roam the school grounds. Timo decided to go to the media room and check out what they were doing, he found a media card on the room.</p>
            <p>Every art has a card that allows one to access different areas, music cards allowed them to go to music rooms, visual arts cards allowed people to go to art classrooms, and theatre cards allowed people to go to some classes and also a very big room. But media cards allowed people to go anywhere, since they where in charge of filming the experience.</p>
            <p>Then, after a while of people doing random things, launch time came, and Sofe told the crew about his boyfriend punching someone in order to stop a fight.</p>
            <p>After that, the students had a bit more freetime to do whatever they wanted. The Media crew was still stuck on doing the video, and the UAS Theatre group still needed a bit more practice, but little by little, the time for the final showdown approached, and then it started.</p>
            <h3>Drama</h3>
            <b>UAS</b>
            <p>It was a play about the study of ancestry where Juanma did the Haka at the end, and it was really funny and it fit under 15 minutes(which was a requirement that only the UAS followed)</p>
            <b>IB Comedy</b>
            <p>I don't remember which school did this one. But they basically parodied the IB experience. They criticised the fact that their school doesn't have many arts. They also made fun of CAS, and it was by far the best play.</p>

Until some guy lifted the table and everyone gave an applause for the display of strength, and from then on, every time he appeared on stage they gave him a round of applause.</p>

            <p>Then they went to a love plaza. In the love Plaza, Sofe talked about her boyfriend Juampi and how she was planning to mary him, Bruno advised to be careful since Sofe had met Juampi quite recently and he might not be what he seems. Sofe dismissed Bruno's warning, saying that she is sure Juampi is the one. Then they went to a second peruvian place where people bought many things, there was a shop with personalised UNO cards which was really cool. </p>

They talked about fine arts and other things that Eitoku missed(Even though he wouldn't have been able to go to SAAC Fine Arts anyways since he wanted to also go to SAAC Volleyball and he wasn't allowed to go to 2 SAAC's because the trips are expensive) Also Eitoku informed Timo that in 2 weeks, he will be able to walk again. Eitoku's spleen exploded, he broke some ribs, his pelvis got damaged, and his arm too. Overall a pretty good outcome give the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Mr Turner tells the class about William Blake's adventures, he starts with poets, and then warns the class that he is going to go on a tangent, and he proceeds to go on a tangent about William Blake. William Blake wrote his poems on plate using some bizarre method with copper and plates or something like that. He wrote the marriage between heaven and hell which had some similar ideas to the ying yang stuff and how there is no evil without good. Also he theorised about forefold vision and he knew stuff he could have only known by talking to dead people which was kind of wild.</p>
          <p>In Chemistry class, they talk about entropy and how the universe is eventually going to die. Sebs didn't really like this class since he fears death and the heat death of the universe.</p>

Thus when anyone is saying anything sarcastically, they usually do so with an exaggeratedly rouph and raspy voice(meant to immitate Mr Lopez's voice). Also worth noting that Mr Lopez is actually one of the best Math teachers out there, this joke just originated from the quarintines because Mr Lopez's voice sounded really rouph through the voicecall. So that's why Dani found Mr Lopez almost crashing funny.</p>

          <p>Sebs and Timo talk about waves. Timo mentions the double slit experiment but Sebas doesn't know what that is. Timo says "everyone knows the double slit experiment" and Sebas bets 50 dollars that Ethan doesn't know what it is. Ethan did know what it is, so Sebs owes Timo 50 dollars.</p>

          <p>Sebas reveals that he was planning to purposely lose the 50 Dollars to Timo so that he would no longer have the motivation to play in the band. So he abandoned the band. During Digital Society, Javi granted Timo and Sebas some time to practice their song, but they just talked in the music room while the rest of the group in Javi's class working on another other things because Javi was grading IAs. </p>
          <p>Timo decides he won't play the song either, and thus, the song was never played, since Ale, Sofe, and Ethan also left the band.</p>
          <p>In Finland, Milla finds a dried out 4-leafed clover on the midddle of the street. It's really surprising because she found it while it was winter, she truly is lucky. She informs the Grass Starers but Timo is skeptical, and Eitoku (who takes biology) analyses the clover and concludes it's a special four leaf clover.</p>

          <p>SAAC Basketball people have left to SAAC Basketball, unfortunately Eitoku hasn't fully recovered and thus he couldn't go to SAAC Basketball. Chad is the only senior to go to SAAC Basketball.</p>
          <p>SAAC Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Maths (STEAM) is happening in UAS and people from other schools will come. This is the first time in a long time that the American School of Asuncion (Paraguay) is being invited to SAAC. They where banned from SAAC because they cheated at a sports SAAC by letting people from outside the school participate. Or at least that is what I heard.</p>

          <p>Sylvia teaches her class about the poems created by Juana de Ibarbourou. Not everyone enjoyed analysing poems. The class analysed three of her poems which can be used for their oral or their Paper 2 exam.</p>
          <b>Rebelde</b>
          <p>It's about someone that tries to rebel against death. She is very angry and she definately doesn't go gentle into that good night. But she dies anyways because it was innevitable.</p>
          <b>La Hora</b>
          <p>A poem that the class has seen before. It compares a woman to a flower but with a sad twist. The poem implies that love can only come from beauty and thus the narrator of the poem urges her lover to enjoy her and love her while she is still pretty like a flower, knowing that she will one day rot like a flower.</p>
          <b>Vida Garfio</b>
          <p>It is a poem about someone telling her lover to burry her in certain places that aren't cementaries. This way she will decompose and live through the nature that absorbs her. I really liked this one personally</p>

          <b>20/04/2023</b>
          <p>SAAC STEAM people do art things, Sofe and Bruno are part of the film crew, and sometimes they film the STEAM Events.</p>
          <p>Bruno officially joins the Wander Warblers Contingent by getting added to the groupchat.</p>
          <p>San shows the spanish class a mixture of several liquids, Timo adds some of his personal chemicals to the mixture</p>
          <p>Sofe and Ale are going to go visit Eitoku after school. Timo tries to give them the <a href="events5.html#eitokushirt"> extra SAAC Fine Arts shirt that Timo got</a>. However Timo was to late and he couldn't deliver it to Sofe. Sofe and Ale played UNO with Eitoku, Ale won 3 times, Eitoku 2, and Sofe 2</p>
          <p>After school, Chiara invites everyone to her house.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="mevent">
            <b>21/04/2023</b>
            <p>Ale stayed for all the morning with Eitoku since his entire class was on SAAC STEAM, so he wasn't going to do much anyways.</p>
            <p>In english everyone records or prepares their orals about Banksy murals. In Advisory, Ines presents her first video as STUCO president, and then Mr Turner takes over with Extended Essay stuff.The class can see everyon's research question and advisor. Timo doesn't have an advisor or research question yet.</p>
            <p>Then, Alex and Sebas ping pong. Timo, Bruno, Sofe, and Juanma talked about SAAC STEAM and how boring it was. Timo also tells Sofe the <a href="events.html#tubesteal">the story of TTG</a>. Bruno and Sofe are part of  the film crew, when the bell wrang, Timo wanted to stay with them but he decided that Digital Society was an important class to go to.</p>
            <p> In that class, he talked to Sebas about Chiara's hang out, and if he was going. Sebas said he probably wasn't going, and Timo said that it was ominous how Chiara out of nowehere put that message, she didn't even ask for a list. They made a joke that perhaps she was planning to do more than just hanging out, maybe she was planning something more malevolent, for this reason, Sebas decided not to go. Timo decided he would take his chances and potentially get murdered.</p>
            <p>In math class, almost no one completed their IA research and Orrico is ultra mad with everyone. Then some Seniors come and give out advice to everyone. Then the teachers leave, and the Seniors start giving some real advice, like saying "Orrico is the best, and with Zarsky you are going to have some problems"-Ida Kirst (a senior)</p>
            <p>Sofe informed Timo that she went to visit Eitoku, and then Sebas said he was going to visit Eitoku this very same day. Timo then had an idea.</p>
            <p>In lunchtime, a part of the WWC sits and talks about random things.</p>
            <p>Alex and Lupi went to talk to Mr Amaral in a ToK session.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>The Warblers in Eitoku's nest</h2>
            <p>Timo reveals to Sebas and Alex that he is coming with them to Eitoku's house. Alex thinks he is joking but no, he is going to give Eitoku the <a href="events5.html#eitokushirt">the SAAC Fine Arts shirt</a>. They talk about the following things.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Favorite Shows</b>

                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Timo</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Better Call Saul (He hasn't watched breaking bad)</li>
                      <li>How I Met your mother</li>
                      <li>Daybreak</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p >They also talk about Video games</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And at the end, Timo asks "What was your greatest rushed homework" And Sebas said that it was <a href="events.html#speach">his speach in 10nth grade</a>. Sebas' speach was probably the best speach in the entire class, and he finished all of it the day before, he said "When I was writing, it was like- smoke was coming off the paper". Timo said that it was an essay about 1984, it is his best essay yet and he wrote it in 30 minutes on lunch time.</p>
            <p>Then they started talking about the speeches, Sebas made a blatant claim that he rememberd everyone's speech topic, which was quickly proven wrong since he actually remembered almost no one's.</p>
            <p>Sebas leaves to his house, since he must get Eitoku's basketball sweater. Alex and Timo continue towards Eitoku's house.</p>
            <p>Once they get there, they have to wash their hands, and make sure they are sanitized before entering. Once they do, Eitoku says hi to all, and they talk a bunch about random things, Eitoku mentions that he has a chess board and they put the SAAC Basketball game since Chad is playing.</p>
            <p>They see that the UAS team is winning 50-20 and there is no way the other team is coming back, so they just admire the plays while they eat food that Eitoku's mom made for them, they discoverd that they called popcorn "cotufas".</p>
            <p>After a while, Sebas came, and he witnessed the match, and how much they where winning by. Sebas brought the sweater, and then Timo brought the SAAC Fine Arts T-Shirt, Eitoku said that both were really good. He enjoyed the backside of the Basketball SAAC Hoodie, and he enjoyed the Symbol of SAAC Fine Arts.</p>

              <p class="itg">Sebs came</p>
            </div>
            <p>They talked about many different things, among them, they talked about the impending volleyball match tomorrow. Sebas and Alex say that they used to find all the girls in the class annoying but now they no longer find them annoying. Sebas and Alex wonder if this shift occured because the girls changed or because they changed.</p>
            <p>They read a whatsapp message that says that the Chiara's meeting was canceled because only 6 people where showing up.</p>
            <p>And after the match ended, they started playing UNO. Timo noticed some customisable cards and he decided to create a card, he also made Sebas and Alex create a card</p>
            <b>Timo's card: The All Seeing Eye</b>
            <p>When Played, the player can choose to see someone's deck and then change the colour of the round. He drew an eye to represent it.</p>
            <b>Alex's Card: 2 Rule</b>
            <p>If you have 2 cards left but one of them is the 2 Rule card, you can place both of them and win without ever saying "UNO". It also let's you change the colour of round. Alex wrote "2 Rule" in the 2 Rule card</p>
            <b>Sebas' Card: 66 The Gay card</b>
            <p>Because Purple is the gayest colour, and 66 is the gayest number (Derviation of Alex from 69), Sebs made a card named 66, if you had the 66 card, a blue six, and a red six, you can place all three at once to win the game immediately. Sebas drew James Charles aswell as the number 66 to represent the card.</p>
            <div class="img si25">

            <br>
            <p>The first game, Eitoku one first, Alex was second, and Sebas and Timo remained for a long time until Sebs won. The same thing happened another time aswell.</p>
            <p>For the final game, Sebas and Timo shook things up, Sebas won by placing a double +4, and Alex stacked it with a +2 onto Timo. Timo aquired a large amount of cards and waited until Alex and Eitoky had only one, then he traded all of his cards for Eitoku's one card and he won immediately.</p>
            <p>But depite having the entire deck on his hands, Eitoku was managing to keep surviving against Alex until Alex cornered him with a colour change. and Alex won third place epicly.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Some time later, Lara's thing happens, it's a Barbie themed party where all of Lara Berman's friends are invited, although only some came. Peoply like Nata, Toby, and Juanma came. (Toby is a guy who often plays ping pong with Alex, Chad, and Timo. Juanma went to SAAC fine arts with the rest.)</p>
            <p>There was a group of people dancing inside, and another group playing cards outside, they were playing cards against humanity, among this people, Taijia, Ines, and Sofia Marquez could be found, however the game was not very exiting, everyone was bored.</p>
            <p>Timo meets Maggie, a cool girl that talks to him about many things, after some time, they sit outside around a fire, where they meat Alejandro (Not the UAS Alejandro, this is a different one) Alperto, and Isaac, all three come from Lincoln and they were part of STEAM SAAC.</p>
            <p>Maggie tries to explain in English how she almost got kidnapped by a taxi in mexico, but she fails since she barely knows any english. Apparently those friends are there because they know Toby liberman, and they followed him there, but they had to leave quickly, after they left, they called Toby, and they told Toby to pass his phone to Timo. They asked for Maggie's, Timo's, and Annie's phone numbers. (Annie was just there).</p>
            <p>Maggie and Annie were really exited about this, thinking that the boys had some interesting intentions..</p>
            <p>After that, Timo joined the cards against humanity(Spanish version) game and it was actually pretty fun, they ate pizza that Lara's boyfriend (Agustin) brought. But eventually everyone got cold and left, Maggie and Timo stayed talking outside until Maggie also got cold and left, but Timo liked the cold so instead he joined a group of people that was playing a similar game.</p>
            <p>The group of people reminded Timo of groups like the TTG or the WWC, it was that sort of vibe, the type of group that is close. The game that they were playing required people to know about each other, so Timo was horible since he knew no one there and no one knew him. The members of this unkown group wehre Carmen, Nicolas, Sipriano, Nicole, and Josefina. Jose plays videogames, and he likes Math. Sipriano likes Math, and he is also quite social. Josefina is quite similar to Nicolas. Carmen reminded Timo of Milla. Finally, nicole was there, she was the person that Timo got the least information about. The game that they were playing allowed Timo to get quite the idea of how their basic personalities.</p>
            <p>After that, Sipriano went inside, and the rest followed after they heard that there were desserts inside. Timo then followed a group of girls that were talking about exes, and Nata told a story of a terrible and sort of abusive ex that she had, Maggie was also there, and he catched timo up on Nata's story.</p>

            <p>After a while, they all went inside, the close group went back outside, while the people that were inside danced and watched barbie episoded, they were dancing several songs, Timo wasn't dancing until Lara purposefully put "The Other Side", a song Timo knew how to dance to since he sang it in a musical.</p>
            <p>After that, they sat down and lauphed at tales that they had, because most of them know each other from musical comedy classes that they take. Maggie told Timo about her Schizofrenic ex that abandoned her . She apparently hadn't completely gotten over him. Maggie kept telling him about tales of his boyfriend. Apparently, at first, they were really happy, and the boyfriend was really nice to her, but suddenly the boyfriend started distancing away from her, until he declared that they were no longer a thing. And this devastated maggie :( Timo said that sounded like love bombing and that it was really sad how people do that</p>
            <p>However after some long time, Maggie started getting over it, although sometimes she has bad dreams with him.</p>
            <p>After that, Timo said bye to Lara, Maggie, and Annie, and left.</p>

            <h2>Sacramento Trip</h2>
            <p>The Entire class (Except Martina because horseriding and Eitoku because he still can't walk that good) and some of 10nth grade go to Colonia de Sacramento for a school trip. They all go to the bus, and then Timo arrives, late as always. However, Angie arrived even later.</p>
            <p>On the way to Sacramento, everyone put loud music, Sofe slept, Alex and Sebas played Risk, and the teachers talked about philosophical, educational, and school-related topics that were pretty interesting.</p>
            <p>When they get there, they first see a place where people used to trade stuff like leather... and slaves</p>
            <p>After that, they go to a big wall(Muralla in spanish). The wall was broken down but then it was rebuilt and preserved since it had historical significance. They take a picture there. Then they all go and walk around some expensive houses. The houses look very bad but they are expensive because they are old and have historical significance. They walk until they get to a plaza with some mini shops to buy things.</p>

            <p>Camilo tell everyone who wants to go to the bathroom to follow him, and the entire group follows him. After a long while of everyone using a very bad bathroom, some people decide to spend some more time buying stuff to eat at a random shop. Timo also talks with Fede about how the WWC is seperating more and more into 2 different groups.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>These people usually play ping pong, except Fede but he is still here</b>
                <p>Lupi, Chad, Sebas, Fede and Alex</p>
              </li>

              <li>Timo constantly switches between the two and in the future, Eitoku will do the same</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then 10nth and 11nth grade split up and go to different museums, the museums were pretty cool, here are some pictures.</p>
            <div class="img ">

            <p>After going to the museums, everyong gets ready to eat, but they have to wait for 10nth grade who is still in the museum. But after 10th comes out, they go and sit down. The Sofe, Bruno, Ethan, Bruno and Timo talks about Fate and other random things. Then they eat, the food is surprisingly not that bad.</p>
            <p>Then Timo leaves that group and joins Sebas and Fede to wander around. Timo sees an interesting poncho that he thinks about buying. Then they join Angie, Mili, and Mati and they go for a walk. They end up on a beach and start skipping rocks.</p>
            <div class="img si40">
              <img src="img/fieldtrip (8).jpg" class="ing">

            </div>
            <p>Fede is actually really good at skipping rocks. Mati just threw some big rocks in the water and he watched as they splashed around. Timo made the stones bounce on other stones in the water, creating the illusion of skipping rocks. Finally Angie was also pretty good at skipping stones</p>
            <p>After that, a message was sent through the class groupchat. The message anounced that that Camilo wanted to see fede, Timo accompanied Fede back to the plaza, buying the poncho he saw earlier on the way. When they got there, they realized that the entire class had already started leaving. And so everyone rushed back to the bus.</p>
            <p>Then they went to a toro place, but everyone was way too tired here, it wasn't a really interesting thing either so here is a picture. Sebas talked to Timo about Gauchos, Sebs asked the question "Out of all teachers here, who is the most likely to be a gaucho?" they agreed that both Rodrigo and Sylvia had a gaucho vibe</p>

            <p>And Finally, they went to a collector's place, where they saw the biggest collection of pencils in the world. They also got to buy typical things from Uruguay. There where some suspicious jams, like the onion jam, the onion jam was the worst. There was also dulce de leche, cheese, alfajores, and other stuff like that.</p>

In this class they first discuss a potential schedule change where instead of having 4 classes and some events like STUCO, NHS, or MUN at lunch, they could have one period where people can do those things, or homework. Everyone thinks that this is a great idea.</p>
          <p>Ping pong tables were removed because students from a blind school are coming and the school didn't want to make it hard for them to walk through the main hall.</p>
          <p>In spanish class, the entire class does the Que?-so joke for the entire class. Basically its when someone says "so" after someone asks "que".</p>
          <p>Fede creates a groupchat with Lupi, Alex, Chad, Timo, Sebas, and Eitoku. This was created in response to the realisation that Sofe, Bruno, Eitoku, Ethan, and Alejandro have a groupchat called "The Purple Gang" which excludes the rest. Lupi believes that Fede cares too much</p>

          <p>Bruno, Sofe, Ale, and Timo eat hamburgers at Rudy's. Sofe talks about her plans to open up Bobba shops in Uruguay but she says that it will be hard to get suppliers. The group also talks about very random things, at one point, they see Milagros and her brother Maxi get into their car but they decide not to say hi to her for some reason.</p>
          <p>After that, they all ate the burgers and then they payed, but while doing so, Bruno decided not to leave a tip. Timo left a 1 US Dollar tip. Sofe was flabberghasted at how Bruno didn't leave a tip, she found it very disrespectful. Bruno very simply did not care, saying that he didn't want to be paying extra for no reason. The discussion continued as they went to the pet-shop to see the pets.</p>
          <p>After that they walked around and met Young Ginger, a kid from school in Ale's grade(10nth grade) who had a Rap Concert the last Friday. His songs are actually pretty good.</p>
          <p>They walked through some shopping hall that Sofe and Ale had somehow never been to and Timo guided them to a Cafe called "La Isla Cafe". Ale ordered a Brownie and a normal coffee, while Bruno ordered a double shot coffee with chocolate. Bruno really liked his drink, he gave his thanks to the man that had prepared it.</p>

Sofe wanted to go to starbucks, and so everyone decided to go there. Bruno told Timo to get on the backseat of his bike. It was the first time Timo had done this, so he was pretty nerveous.</p>

          <p>The vollayball team must play today, Alex, Luca, Lupi, and the entire volleyball team (Except Fede, he couldn't come this time) is waiting in the bus for Timo who arrives late. But he does eventually arrive, and they go to Olimpia.</p>
          <p>In the bus ride, they play chess.</p>
          <p>Eventually they arrive, it's a huge place, they have to go down some stairs into some shady corridors with piping and water tanks surrounding the entire place, this is because there was also a random underground pool near the volleyball court.</p>
          <p>But after they got through the messy maze of pipes, they start warming up. And they start the first match... things ain't looking too good. For some reason, everything was off, they were beaten 25-17.</p>
          <p>But then, they started to try, and they didn't lose a single game from then on, everything was mostly perfect. But these are the highlights.</p>
          <b>The Highlights</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Alex and Chad together block 3 consecutive strikes, and win the point</li>
            <li>In the final point of a set, Luca, Lupi, and Mati where in front, and they all got to strike. UNnfortunately that point didn't count because someone from the other team got injured.</li>
            <li>The entire game finishes with a strike from Thomas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Those are the main epic plays, but the entire match was played awesomely by the UAS team. Also, this was <a href="others.html#marco">Marco's</a> first time playing as libero. After the game was over a girl approached Alex and gave him her phone with instagram opened. Alex proceeded to input his account onto her instagram search bar, and she said thanks. And then everyone cheers for him. </p>
          <p>Later that day, the Purple Gang has a discussion about English class. Burno is really glad he doesn't have Moskovicks and instead he has Mr Turner for english.

          <p>In the morning, the library is set up with a big projector, there will be a meeting there. Because of this, Chiara gets confused and she starts doubting if this is an A day or a B day.</p>
          <p>In UP class, Andrea asks the class what they think they'll study.</p>
          <b>Their Answers</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Dani:Computer Science</li>

          <p>Mosckovicks isn't here, so they all have class with Kimberly Coyle. They start to watch Hamilton, a musical about a guy that was very relevant to the united states. Many people don't like the musical which is weird because they got to watch a movie in disney+ instead of working on something.</p>
          <p>Ping pong tables are still not up by the way.</p>
          <p>Alex once again has joined Digital Society, he is pretty much a part of the class by now, ever since his presence, the class actually started to do work.</p>
          <p>Also, a kid called Jermiah comes to school to visit, he is from piriapolis and is planning to maybe join this school, he is already taking the IB (You won't hear about Jeremiah again)</p>

          <p>Physics class starts the topic of standing waves. The chemistry class has an advantage since they covered the basics of standing waves because electrons around the nucleus of atoms are standing waves. The Electron Standing waves only interfere constructively at certain distances from the nucleus which is what causes their orbitals to be quantised.</p>
          <p>Sebas does not remember anything about Chem and the electrons being standing waves. Timo tries to explain but Sebas urges him to stop.</p>

            <h3>The Friday Half Day</h3>
            <p>It's also book day, a StuCo event. Dress up as a book character to win class points</p>
            <p>In UP Class, a dog suddenly enters the class and everyone is confused, then they get it out, and it roams the halls with people following the dog. Apparently it's from someone next to the school, and it almost bit Ms Mosckovicks.</p>
            <p>In ToK class, Mr Turner is dressed up as James Joyce, because it's book character dress up day. Fede is dressed up as the cat in the hat and Timo is Holden Caufield. James Joyce writes a lot of stream of conciousness, which is really confusing and almost immposible to read. James Joyce has written a lot of things, the most confusing piece he has created is probably Finnegans Wake. James Joyce inserts himself into his stories, so Turner can dress up as him and it still counts since it technically still is a book character.</p>
            <p>In chemistry, everyone works on the lab, but no one except Lucas finishes, so they must stay after school.</p>
            <p>In physics, they learn about more properties of standing waves.</p>
            <p>Then Timo started finishing his Lab, he actually did his entire lab that day. Eventually, Alex and Lupi enter the lab to finish their experiments aswell.</p>

            <p>Alex has finished his experiment, but now he has to clean. Alex used crystal violet which stained the beakers strongly, it was nearly immposible to get it out. To make matters worst, Alex was supposed to be in a Math HL class and Mr Lopez needed his help with a problem.</p>
            <p>Timo offered to clean the beakers so that Alex could attend the Math HL class and not fall behind. He also offered to clean Lupi's beaker which used Methylene blue, another really potent staining chemical. He managed to clean them all which was immpressive to Lupi and Alex.</p>
            <p>While Timo was cleaning, Lupi decided to do the actualy Blue Bottle experiment, and he did it, here is the video.</p>

          <p>The UAS girls team plays, and it's not looking too good for them. But while they are playing and eating food (They brought food) Eitoku appears behind them, and they all say hi.</p>
          <p>After a while of the girls playing, it's now the boys' turn, and the boys of the other team are really good. At first, no one knew how to defend correctly, Timo even got hit in the face really hard when the opponent spiked the ball. But then the other games were closer. UAS still did not win.

          <p>So Alex, Chiara, Chad, and Timo are in the library at the morning, Timo really does not want to go th UP. They talk about the Group 3 subjects and how Chiara really hated History, and Timo regrets not taking History.</p>
          <p>Chad then goes to Mr Williams to ask him why d=tv doesn't work in Simple Harmonic Motion, Williams said that he was supposed to use the sinusodial equations that he gave out.</p>
          <p>In ToK, Mr Turner starts talking about how everyone is addicted to their phone and how everyone became too passive and docile. He also explained that because of technology, less and less people are going out for walks and exposing theirselves to the world which reduces the chances of serendipity ocurring which is bad.</p>
          <p>The physics class has it's second HL only class. Martina has missed a lot of HL classes so she decided to leave Physics HL and take Economics HL instead. Ethan, Dani, Sebas, Timo, and Alex are the ones who remain in Physics HL.</p>
          <p>Bruno tells the Purple Gang about <a href="others.html#domtron">Dominic Tornquist.</a> A very evil person that has done just about anything that's considered bad. He is also really smart and very manipulative. If Bruno's stories are correct, Dominic once forced someoen to drink her own period blood, and that's not even the worst.

And that to avoid this, everyone should always keep in mind that there are many other ways of seeing things. Dani reflected that even though he is right, he is not going to change anything, and everyone would make a decision to ignore him.

            <p>Something that I failed to communicate to you, is that ever since <a href="events.html#ohmili">this event</a>, Mili insisted Timo to invite everyone to his house again, since she couldn't be there because his father caught her with Marijuana.

          <p>The physics class has a Test about waves, and on one is confident.</p>
          <p>The Economics class has a test. And also, advisory time!</p>
          <p>In advisory, the teachers decided to give everyone a study hall. The physics group studied physics, because they have a test today.</p>
          <p>Turns out that the test was much easier than what anybody anticipated, but let's here some tale from the purple gang</p>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <b>The tale</b>
          <p> Sofe needed to finish essays for economics, and she also needed to study for a test and she also needed to finish english homework. So she drank a magical potion that allowed her to stay awake at the cost of some of her mental and physical health (She drank like 3 monster energies). She managed to finish it all, but then she kinda died the next day.</p>
          <p>But she came back for the last 2 periods, and she said hi to everyone while still looking like she was raised from the dead.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Then, Alex, Lupi, Timo and Chad played ping pong while Martina watched Lupi vs Eitoku, however out of nowhere, Timo had to leave to go to Argentina apparently. Chad, Alex, and others also had a meeting with Mosckovicks about the oral.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p><b>Note:</b>Dani likes sending things to Sebastian, but sometimes he sends too many things. So he asks Timo to send him some special things which he thinks that are truly important. Timo acts like the messanger of important things. This has been going on for a while, but today is the first time that Dani tells Timo to send a message to someone who isn't Sebas, in this case, Eitoku.</p>

          <b>30/05/2023</b>
          <p>In the English class, Martina apparently turned in some late homework. She asked Moskovicks why she had an F in power school. Moskovicks said that it was because Martina had turned in her work late. Then they argued for 20 minutes and the discussion ended with Moskovicks stating something along the lines of ~"The F stays there because you annoyed me". The entire class trembles and worries about their future with Moskovicks as their only English teacher, since Coyle will be leaving.</p>
          <p>In Math class, the class plays a gambling game. You must pick a letter from A to J and a Number from 1 to 10. Mr Zarsky will then create a random combination inbetween a letter and a number. If you have a number match your money is multiplied by 2, if you get the full match, you get the jackpot, and your money is multiplied by ten. Everyone started on 1000 dollars and if they got to 10000, they got 5 extra points for the test.</p>
          <p>In the first round, Sebas won the half match, and Timo decided to bet and then lose 998 dolllars, leaving him with only 2.</p>
          <p>In the second round, Sebas wins the half match again, and Timo also wins the half match, leaving him with 4 dollars.</p>
          <p>In the third round, Timo wins a the jackpot, getting him 44 dollars.</p>
          <p>Sebas was the one with the most money, and Timo got the least.</p>

              <p>Also, everyone brings back Clash Royale, they are playing it in the flex space. Flex Spaces are short for flexible workspaces, there is one upstairs and one downstairs. It has couches, tables, and computers. Often used by students to do anything but work, used for actual work every once in a while.</p>

              <p>Classes are shorter to make space for the award ceremony, almost everyone in the class won an award.</p>
                <!--I won my first award-->
              <p>Then Timo and Sebas play ping pong while complaining about how long the award ceremony was. Sebas has started to take an interest in ping pong, he has been practicing for the last 2.5 weeks and he improved quite a bit, his goal is to defeat Alex some day. Giovvange( a guy who won many awards, he is from the same grade as Marco Lupinacci) congratulates Timo on winning his award.</p>
              <p>Then, in the Math classroom, Alex comes and goes away, then Fede comes and congratulates Timo on winning his first award.</p>
              <p>In lunch, Timo and Eitoku decide to sit outside while discussing things. They sat on a table that had very shiny screws in the center tube. Timo explains that the reason why the screws are new is because of the <a href="events.html#tubesteal">Table Tube Gang Origin</a>. Eitoku also said that he had left the IB because he found it really hard to catch up with all the work. Plus he didn't really need the IB diploma.</p>
              <p>Then out of nowhere, Fede arrives, then Sebas, then Sofe, and they talk about random stuff. Eitoku and Sofe walk away and talk privately about something that they didn't want anyone else to hear</p>
              <p>In the final class, the electricity is shut down, so Alex, Lupi, and Lucas can’t proceed with their extended essay experiments which require electricity</p>
              <p>Mr Turner gives a big talk about the Extended Essay steps, and he creates a point system that awarded people based on their Extended Essay Word count, as well as the attention that they payed in to him.</p>
              <p>Throughout his speech, Chiara draws Chad, Alex, and others, Mili used her phone, and Martina arrived to bothered people using the reflection of sunlight on her phone. Safe to say most people didn't pay attention.</p>

              <p>Mr Turner then lets everyone go to the flex space before the class ends, and just when it ends, the lights go back on.</p>
              <p>But Lupi already had cleaned the lab and put away his equipment, so he decided to play 2v1 ping pong against Eitoku and Timo, it was close, but Eitoku and Timo ended up winning.</p>
              <p>Then they went to volleyball.</p>

          <p>Mati and Luca play clash royale. Once they get there, they notice that Alex, Lupi, Chad, and Eitoku haven't arrived yet, they all arrive late but still in time for some warm up.</p>
          <p>The first game was the one everyone played the best. The most notable play is one that lasted for ~40 seconds, and it was full of blocking and spiking.</p>

          <p>They went to the bus, played clash royale, and left to their respective classes.</p>
          <br>
          <p>At night, at 21:40, Mati sends something to the class groupchat. He says that we should talk to the English teachers about the fact that we have 2 finals for that class instead of one. Many people agree, but I still have a feeling no one will really do anything.</p>

          <p>Mr Turner in ToK talks first about some of his tales from old school. He talks about a girl that took a selfie of her in an ambulance after she attempted suicide, then he talks about TikTok and hot it's not good. He goes outside and talks about the birds. The Ibis is a bird that irrigates the earth while hunting for birds with it's large beak. He says the birds are more useful than humans. Then he talks about Mimesis, philosophers, greek tragedies. Then Timo says "Edipous was much more likeable" the Turner says "That would be a great extended essay question".</p>
          <p>Turner talks about how sometimes, you just have to chose some direction in life even if you don't know if it's the best direction. Sometimes indecision can paralyse you, and it's always good be moving. He then talks about other extended essay questions, like "To what extent does twilight have literary merit"</p>
          <p>Then he talks about movies, and he shows the class the movie "Apocalypse Now" and how it depitcted the US as bad. He shows the scene where the vietnam village gets absolutely destroyed.</p>

          <p>Everyone is at English class, but no one actually knows when the senior breakfast is happening and Coyle is stressed because of everyone's lack of organisation. Eventually they decided they go whenever they want to after 8:30. So some people went there while others learned more about the books that they are studying. They created connections by comparing and contrasting all the literary works and seeing what themes they share in order to use them properly for their Individual Oral and their Paper 2 english exam. Eventually everyone went to the Breakfast, there was nothing healthy there but it was all delicious.</p>

          </ul>
          <p><b>Fun Fact:</b>Bruno Nario Dupuy never dressed up for any StuCo event. Like not even once, not even by accident</p>
          <p>Anyways, after that, Mili anounced the new topic of the soon-to-start class discussion, the Senior Sweaters. All seniors have to have their sweaters, but the class couldn't really decided how they wanted it. They voted on the colour Lilac once through a digital form. But some people wanted to change the colour to Malbec, Milagros argued that there had been a vote in the Whatsapp Groupchat that said that no one wanted to vote again for the colours.</p>
          <p>The class discussion devolved into discord and chaos as it became a shouting contest. The teachers decided to play with balloons because they were bored, Alex, Chad, Lupi, Timo, Lucas and Sebas couldn't care less about the T-Shirts so they began playing Chess and Clash Royale.</p>
          <p>In ToK, they talked about many things like how phones are now considered a Mental Hazard in the US.</p>
          <p>In Chemistry they just studied Chemistry.</p>
          <p>It was a Rainy day, meaning that no one went outside to eat. Everyone sat at a table. Sofe, Timo, Bruno, and Ale sat on a seperate table because it was filled with too many people.</p>
          <p>After that, Eitoku, Sofe, Timo and Ale played some volleyball, they talked about how they were going to arrive to prom, Sofe wanted to arrive in a group withe everyone, but most people said that they wouldn't make it, so she decided to invite her boyfriend.</p>
          <p>In physics, Timo, Sebas, and Dani studied while Martina, Matias, Luca, Alex, and Chad were trying out pick-up lines and lauphing, and there was also some studying done there.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Later that day, the graduation happened, not all the class attended it, Dani, Chiara, and Luca did, Luca got selected as the as the keeper of the Senior key.</p>

          <h2>Prom</h2>
          <p>In Prom, everyone dances, the entire class came, everyone except Ethan and Bruno. Juampi (Sofe's boyfriend) also came to the party. The teachers were dancing and people took pictures in the photobooth. There was also stuff to eat, popcorn, cake, and other sweet things.</p>

          <p><b>Date:</b>11/06/2023</p>
          <p><b>Climate:</b>Cold</p>
          <p><b>Location:</b>The School and Chiara's House</p>
          <br>
          <p>Now everyone is leaving and getting the stuff from the little deposit center that was there, everyone was trying to find a way to go to Chiara's house, Timo took Sebas, and Timo got a Chivito on the way to Chiara's.</p>
          <p>These seniors had apparently failed to plan an afterprom. The school only lets people stay there until 12 and then everyone gets kicked out. That is why it is tradition for the seniors to do an afterprom party where alcohol and drugs are allowed and people dance for much longer. However these seniors didn't plan an afterprom.</p>
          <p>Chiara had invited everyone to her house after Martina said she wasn't allowed to invite everyone to her house, and Martina had tried to invite everyone to her house because there was no clear signs of an afterprom, and everyone wanted an after prom. The Class of 2024 was going to kind of create their own afterprom. Howwever it turns out that the seniors did do some kind of afterprom party in someone's house, but it was very improvised.</p>
          <p>So now that everyone knew that there was an afterprom, some people decided to go(Chiara and Milagros)</p>
          <p>But not before doing some stuff, so here are some stuff that happened. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Chiara gets drunk and lauphs at everything</p></li>
            <li><p>Eitoku got destroyed by Lupi and by Timo in clash royale<p/></li>
            <li>
              <p>Timo goes outside, and sees Sebas and Angie talking, Sebas directs to Timo. Some time ago Timo told Sebas that Angie dyed her hair blonde, Sebas didn't believe him, this happened in the date <a href="events3.html#19/09/2022">19/09/2022</a>. Sebas was confused, and Timo re-assured Sebas that <a href="events3.html#lies">he never lies.</a>  Turns out that Angie's hair was indeed dyed blonde and her natural hair colour is brown.</p>
              <p>Lupi tried to do the Mentos-and-Coke reaction, but he used Mint Gum instead of mint thinking it would work (Higher Level Chemistry thought process). It didn't work so they kicked the bottle in frustration.</p>

          <br>
          <p>People start arriving at their final english class, to take their final. Timo gives Martina a birthday present that he forgot to give her yesterday (UNO Cards Harry Potter). Everyone is nerveous about the test, and then Coyle starts to explain the test. There was one common problematic question about comic relief that no one understood, but apart from that it was okay for most people.</p>
          <p>Martina invites Alex and Eitoku to her house to wait for the volleyball event that happens today, it is an event were parents, teachers, and students can play. After that Timo plays clash royale with Eitoku.</p>
          <p>Art students don't have a final today because they have a project instead, so they are free to do whatever they want, this is not the case for Digital Society students who have to do a very long final. Timo finishes it and decides to go play ping pong. Then Mosckovicks is mad at him because he didn't go get a book that he was supposed to go get.</p>
          <p>After that, Alex and Eitoku went to Martina's, and the rest went to their homes, except Chad, he stayed in school.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>In the volleyball event everyone played really badly against the parents and teachers so somehow they lost. It was really fun though</p>

          <p><b>Location:</b>School </p>
          <br>
          <p>Alex and Dani do their Math Test, Timo does the physics re-take, Sebas, Eitoku, and Sofe do an English oral.</p>
          <p>After that, Eitoku, Alex and Sebs all leave together.</p>
          <p>Timo has a final talk with Dani, they talk about the Math and the Physics tests and how Dani had to do the English oral. Dani also swore the flag today. They then talked about Physics HL, Timo said that he is not leaving even if he gets bad grades and Dani says he doesn't want to be a quitter either. Danis does admit that if there was Music IB in the school he would have definately taken Music instead of physics, Timo would have done the same aswell.</p>
          <p>Baranzano(The music teacher) comes just in time and Dani asks him why there is no IB Music. Mr Baranzano says that the school is actually working on it?! but the reason why there wasn't is because there were not enouph people that wanted to take music. However there are more students that want to so now the school might consider adding IB Music. Timo is sad because he didn't get this choice. Baranzano says that at least the next generation might have music, and then he says "Bueno, me voy a hacer una consulta". Dani says that the way Mr Baranzano speaks is very similar to the way Timo speaks. Timo mentions that although what Dani said might be true, Baranzano always has some random proverbs that Timo likes, he mentions "No salio la foto"(A proverb Mr Baranzano said after Timo failed to gather band members for coffee house[It means that things just didn't work out]) and "Muzzzzzzarella"( A saying Mr Baranzano said when he wanted Timo to keep a secret[It is the equivalent of Shhhhhhhhhhh]). Then Dani leaves.</p>
          <p>Eitoku, Alex, and Sebas plan to go eat something and then go watch the spiderman movie.</p>
          <h2>Spider-Verse Stuff</h2>
          <p>So Timo, Alex and Ethan go to the Mc Donalds at Punta Carretas, Alex orders a McFlurry, Timo orders some chips and Ethan orders a burger. Ethan apparently has a plan to become really good at chess, he wants to beat Timo, but to do that he will first have to beat Alex, Lupi, Dani, and Chad.</p>
          <p>After that, Sebas and Eitoku come, and they all go to the Movie. Alex manages to lose his ticket after 3 minutes and 25 seconds of aquiring it. They search and they search to no avail until Alex notices that it fell through a little space in between the popcorn-containing glass and the counter.</p>
          <p>So the staff informs the lady at the entrance that Alex is dumb and he lost his ticket so that the lady lets Alex get in. And then they all go to watch the movie.</p>
          <p>The movie is great and it ends with a cliff hanger. Here is everyone's opinions on it.</p>
          <b>The Opinions</b>
          <ul>
            <li><p><b>Eitoku:</b>It was really good</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Sebas:</b>Too long, Sebas sayd that this might be because he has a "Tik-Tok attention span"</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Alex:</b>Alex fell asleep after the most exciting scene in the movie</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Ethan:</b>Ethan thinks it was a masterpiece.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Timo:</b>Pretty funny</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>After that, they all go outside, they walk for a bit, they reflect on the movie, except Alex who just took a nap in the movie theatre. Alex gave Eitoku and Sebas a mexican spice that they liked called aji, then they put it on the extra popcorn that Eitoku didn't eat.</p>

      <h2>The End of IST</h2>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <p>So, what can we derive from this? Well, while I write down summaries for the days, it's hard to capture how the entire class feels, so I will just tell you why this was called impending suddent times. It is because suddenly, everything, all the IA's the CAS Projects and Reflections, the IA's, everything just never stopped coming. All of a sudden. So I made a list of things that came out of nowhere unexpectedly and where very impactful to the class.</p>
      <b>Impending Sudden Things</b>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Literally Moskovicks:</b> She definately added to the "Sudden " component, given that she posted homeworks very late in the day with ludicrous deadlines. No one likes Moskovicks' style, Martina even had a 20 minute discussion with her about her grade. </p></li>
        <li><p><b>Math Internal Assesment:</b> So Math HL had to literally just do their entire internal assesment. The rest did only half of it. Alex did none of it because he accidentally made an Extended Essay while trying to make an Internal Assesment. This is good though, but now he has no Math Internal Assesment.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>CAS Reflections and Project:</b> Many people made them up because they forgot they were due at the end, not really sudden.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Extended Essay:</b> The Extended Essay days were useful for many, but also really stressful.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>English Orals: </b> Moskovicks again, she decided to assign many orals to the class so that they could practice for the official IB oral. However she only gave the class 3 days to prepare for the oral.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Spanish Oral:</b> Although this was the official IB Oral, it was still easier than the english Oral because the teacher gave the students 1.25 months to prepare it.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>ToK Exhibtion:</b> People must choose objects and answer ToK prompts with them, no one really knows what they are doing, not even Turner because it's a new thing in IB.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Physics HL:</b> Physics started to get harder and people are seriously considering leaving, specially Alex and Sebas because they are already (technically) taking 4 HL's because Spanish Learning is technically an HL. However, Dani and Timo will most definately remain in Higher Level.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Eitoku's Fall:</b> Out of literally no where Eitoku falls off a balcony of 6-8 floors of height(not sure about the specifics) and narrowly avoids meeting his ancestors. But not only did he survive, he practically made a full recovery and survived and regained his ability to walk within a month. Turns out he didn't exactly fall on accident but I will explain that in the future.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Senior Year:</b> But all of this, it was the prologue, the introduction, the cliffhanger before the entire disaster unfolds, everyone so far has told the students that what they experienced this year, was nothing compared to whatever the hell that senior year is. The Senior year, is the true impending event.</p></li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Other things</b>
        <p>After Eitoku's accident, his parents want him to leave Uruguay and go back to Japan, Eitoku wants to stay, but it's his parents' decision.</p>
        <p>Sweaters of seniors, the class has not decided on the colour, on the design, it's not looking good when it comes to the class of 2024 sweaters.</p>
        <p>There might be a new student that arrives next year ()</p>
