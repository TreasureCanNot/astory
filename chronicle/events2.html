          <p><b>Final Advisory 03/06/2022:</b>The class plays fishbowl. Everyone writes something in a strand of paper(It must be something everyone knows about) and all of the papers are double folded and put in a bowl. Groups are made, one person from each group must read the paper and say anything except the words in the paper, the rest of the group has to guess what the paper says.</p>
          <p>An amazing end to the advisory journey, I am glad that the group did not discuss anything serious this time. The game was a perfect ending because most of the words or phrases where references to the past events of weird era. Here are the references I remember.(The parenthesis is the word in the papre "Word or phrase in paper")</p>

          <h3>Fishing</h3>
          <b>05.06.2022</b>
          <b>Megan and Timo</b>
          <p>The Table Tube Gang wants to go fishing. But they need to wake up really early in the morning so almost none of them go except Megan, Timo and Alex.</p>
          <p>Timo arrived at Megan's house and went to piriapolis. They meet with Alex and his family, Alex is with someone named Emiliano</p>
          <p>Everyone went fishing. Timo had glass, and a man on the boat told Timo that fishermen with gloves never catch fish. Timo then getting 3 fishes in 7 minutes, however he stopped after the third fish because he started feeling bad for the fishies. Instead he tried giving his luck to Alex who was struggling to get one fish..</p>
          <br>
          <div class="img" style="width:400px;">
            <img src="img/timofish.jpg" class="ing">
            <p class="itg">Timo and his victim</p>
          </div>
          <p>Megan did not want to catch a fish but was still pretending to try, eventually she just stopped trying and sat down besides Alex and Timo. Someone named Elena was there aswell. At some point Megan attempted to scare the fishes away so that Alex wouldn't be able to catch them.</p>
          <b>Lightning events</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Timo informs Alex of <a href="events.html#thejoke">THE JOKE</a> with indirect clues</li>
            <li>Alex tries to figure out the joke.</li>
            <li>Megan is informed of THE JOKE. Timo and Sebas had made a good job in ensuring that everyone spreads the myth that Sebas is good at ping pong. So much so that Megan believed it aswell.</li>
            <li>Timo analyses Alex's breakup song</li>
            <li>Alex is tasked with analysing Timo's breakup song</li>
            <li>Alex got 3 fishes over the course of 1 hour and 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Alex tries to figure out THE JOKE, claiming he is the ultimate detective.</li>
            <li>They talk about anime</li>
            <li>Timo tells them that he found an abandoned neighbourhood</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After that they go to another fishing spot, where they talk a bit more.</p>
          <p>Then they ate at a resaurant where Timo expains how he saw bones in an abandoned neighborhood. Then they ate ice-cream, Megan suggested for everyone to go visit the abandoned neighborhood place.</p>
          <b>Come-back</b>
          <p>Timo and Megan slept in the ride home, They woke up and Timo showed Megan the abandoned neighborhood. Also Timo told Megan about this website right here. This made Megan want to stay in UAS since she could appear in the story more. Then Timo fell asleep and Megan took this picture</p>

           <b>Physics</b>
           <p>Marina and Timo are the only ones in the class. Timo told Marina about the fishing. They did a virtual lab while Mr Williams talked about a sport called rounders, which was like baseball but more fun, aswell as medical problems like needles and diseases.</p>
           <b>Chemistry</b>
           <p>The class did an experiment where they took Hydrochloric acid and combined it with sodium carbonate. They had to find the theoretical mass of the carbon dioxide produced by the reaction and then compare it to experimental mass. Some got it good some didn't.</p>
           <b>Recess</b>
           <p>Some played ping pong, some where just talking or doing other stuff</p>
           <b>English</b>
           <p>The two classes reviewd for the exam final and Timo wasted Alex's time. Mili arrived</p>
           <b>Computer Sciences</b>
           <p>It was in the library because of MAP testing and only three people where present, Timo, Mili, and ALex. They worked on coding. Timo and Alex played chess, and Timo destroyed Alex twice</p>
           <b>Lunch</b>
           <p>Timo and Alex played some ping pong as well.</p>
           <p>Fede and Megan where going around the school talking. The rest of the people where talking in a table in the cafeteria.</p>
           <p>Timo joined the cafeteria people and told Marina about his plan to share with everyone a collaborative document with docs for physics in IB, Marina told Timo that there was a chance she would leave before going to IB. This was the moment Timo realised his <a href="events.html#dream"></a> might be correct</p>
           <b>Math</b>
           <p>In core math the class just worked on khan academy while talking about iced coffee vs coffee and other coffee related things. There was only Lucas, Mati, Timo, and Marina.</p>
           <p>Megan bought prom tickets for Sebas and Timo, the prom tickets look really cool but I lost mine and I forgot to take a picture.</p>

         <li class="border1p">
           <p><b>07/06/2022:</b>This time everyone is sick too</p>
           <b>Those who came</b>
           <ul>
             <li>Martina (sick)</li>
             <li>Milagros (sick)</li>
             <li>Lucas (sick)</li>
             <li>Timoteo (sick)</li>
             <li>Bruno (sick)</li>
             <li>Santina</li>
             <li>Matias</li>
             <li>Lupinacci (sick)</li>
             <li>Daniel</li>
           </ul>
           <b>Spanish</b>
           <p>Timo arrives, then Daniel, and eventually spanish starts. The class identifies literary devices in spanish class</p>
           <p>Dani and Martina have an intense argument over the letters J and G and their pronounciation.</p>
           <b>Break</b>
           <p>Dani got vaccinated in his right arm, so now he plays with his left arm, he thinks it looks cooler to paly with his left, and now he wants to play with his left forever, Timo destroyed him though. Lupi played ping pong with Mati. Martina and Mili where walking around talking.</p>
           <b>UP History</b>
           <p>Daniel was looking at the math hl syllabus in UP history, and he tried to grasp some mathematical concepts, he was worried about the IB and college, he asked Karina(the teacher) how studying in college was like, she said she was the kind of person who studied a lot. Meanwhile Timo found a way to edit a text file by replacing it then renaming it again, he was really proud of his accomplishments. Also Lucas left for phisiotherapy and Milagros just left for no given reason</p>
           <b>US History</b>
           <p>The class played ping pong with 2 desks in history.  After that Eveyone just worked on stuff or did nothing. They were all sending gifs through the discord. Timo left history, said hi to Alex and Megan who were in lunch, and then came back to the class. </p>
           <b>Lunch</b>
           <p>Daniel played ping pong with Timo, he liked playing with his left hand, he wants to become a left handed player. After that Timo joined Lupi, Matias and Martina who where talking about prom invitations. Matias and Lupi totally wanted to go together to prom but none of them had the courage to ask each other out, both where trying to get the other to ask. They tried to make Timo invite Mili, but Timo did not want to. Then everyone tried making Martina invite Dani, but she didn't want to.</p>
           <b>PE</b>
           <p>More than half of the class was missing so Jeff decided to let everyone study or workout. In the library, Timo told Dani that Josh was thinking of inviting Marina to prom, Dani said that there was no way she would say yes, but Timo disagreed. Dani went on a tanjent about how Josh did not rank high in the "attractivness scale" and he proceeded to show Timo the aforementioned attractivness scale, which was actually a tierlist. Timo thought that attractivness is relative and putting beauty on a scale was preposterous. Bruno agreed with Timo, but then Bruno started saying stuff that no one understood. Dani started arguing with Bruno about the importance of looks, the meaning of the word "perfect", and the meaning of the word "normal". Timo found the discussion too intense to participate in, so he talked a bit with Lucas. Bruno believed that the words "normal" and "perfect", should not exist, I don't really know what he meant by that. Dani left because he got tired, Lucas and Timo followed, leaving Bruno alone. After that some played volleyball, some worked out, some went to sleep.</p>
           <p>Meanwhile there were people in the gym talking and training</p>
           <b>After that</b>
           <p>Timo, Alex, and Lupi played ping pong, very evenly matched between all three players.</p>
           <b>Volleyball</b>
           <p>Timo was very tired, so his surfs where weird, this weird surfs lead him and Luca taccone to win a game against the volleyball teacher, lupi, and Alex</p>
         </li>

           </ul>
           <b>Physics</b>
           <p>In physics people continued the lab they where working on a force, mass, and acceleration lab. In physics Milla tells Mr Williams that vikings didn't invade finland because they had wizards, or at least that's what Milla learned while she was in finland.</p>
           <b>Break</b>
           <p>Dani continues to practice with his left hand in ping pong, he says that he is going to practice for all break in a ping pong table that he has in spain. He has improve since the last time, like at least he can hit the ball back 75% of the time.</p>
           <b>English</b>
           <p>People where just studying, coyle was absent and thus Andrea took over. Martina was sat in a corner of the room and she was absolutely suffering because she was sick. Martina's infirmity was so great that it caught Andrea's attention, Martina went back home.</p>
           <b>Computer Science</b>
           <p>Alex played Timo in chess, however Timo underestimated Alex and for the first time, Timo didn't win against Alex in chess, it was a tie. Then Timo played another game in which Alex got destroyed. Alex then said that he would beat Timo in ping pong during lunch.</p>
           <b>Lunch</b>
           <p>Alex prepared to play ping pong, saying "you might be better at chess but I'll destroy you in ping pong". Alex then proceeds to lose <b>11-2</b> which is his worst loss yet. However it's fitting since his favourite number is apparently 2.</p>
           <b>Math</b>
           <p>Mr.Zarzky gave everyone time to study, Orrico came to survey the class on who was taking Math Analysis and Approaches (AA) in the IB. Everyone who was taking Math AA just happened to not be there.</p>
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
           <p>The table tube gang was summoned to fede's house, Sebas played "frame it" against Sebas while Milla and Megan just watched, then Megan played chackers against Timo who wanted to play chess</p>
           <p>After that, a play happened, where Nata was one of the actresses, the play was about how women are treated in society, not very well turns out. Timo, Marina, Mili, Angie, San and Mati where there.</p>

           <b>US History</b>
           <p>Some people took the final in this class, but others where exempt since they got A's, those who where exempt worked on an experimental science lab.</p>
           <b>Lunch</b>
           <p>Normal lunch, except for this day, ping pong tables where taken away, and thus ping pong was not palyable. The ping pong tables were taken because of prom preparations.</p>
           <b>PE/ART</b>
           <p>The gym was occupied due to the graduation and also the prom, and thus the class was free to do anything. San and Lupi played video games, girls went to the lockeroom to talk, Timo realised his phone was missing and went in an adventure of self discovery to find it.</p>
           <b>PE</b>
           <p>The Gym is being used for prom, so people just play video games, watch movies, and talk to Jeff, however Timo did something a little bit different.</p>
           <p>Timo was supposed to go to PE, but they weren't doing anything because the gym was being used for PROM. So he decided to go find his phone, first he went to the music room where he tried to find Mr Baranzano, since Timo though he might have forgot it while the concert was going, he failed to find him though, after that he went to the spanish class, but ran into the art class. Alex was working really hard on his final and fede advised Timo not to distract him. Megan helped Sebas finish his project. Megan, Timo, and Sebas where talking when Megan told Timo to sign her goodbye frisbee, Sebas did not want Timo to sign it, since that would seal Megans fate of leaving Uruguay, Timo agreed with Sebas' reasoning. After that Megan gave Timo his prom ticket.</p>
           <p>Then the art class started their presentations. After Sebas and Fede finished presenting, Timo remembered that he was not supposed to be there and he went back to PE. Everyone in PE was wondering where the hell he had gone. Timo told them his story.</p>
           <p>Jeff told him to go look for Mr Baranzano again so he can find his phone, and so he did. He failed to find him. He also went to search in Foege's classroom and every single classroom he had been on, but still he could not find it. However, he found Megan's jester hat in Foege's class, and he realised something huge. Timo went back to Jeff, and Jeff bet 10 dollars that Timo's phone was on his back pack. It was not</p>
           <p>Timo then went to the art class and gave Megan the Jester hat, and he also signed the goodbye frisbee. Everyone left a little note in the frisbee, Timo's note said "There are cool things". Sebas did not like this because this symbolically shows that Megan's fate is now sealed and she will be leaving to the US. Timo found his phone 2 minutes after that, it wasn't on his back pack, it was on his case :)</p>

          <h3>Prom 11/06/2022</h3>
           <p>So Fede asked Alex to go to prom with him, this was as a joke, except that everyone knows that Fede is gay. It's not confirmed, he hasn't anounced it, but everybody pretty much knows. Alex said yes to continue the joke but it was kind of awkward for him.</p>
           <p>At the entrance of the school, you could see a wallpaper to take photos, aswell as guards, then there where stars in the floor with the names of the seniors, aswell as powerful stage lights illuminating the hallways.</p>

           <br>
           <p>The party was in the gym, in the center of the gym there was industrial piping holding lights and speakers. Surrounding the center where some tables, a popcorn stand, and a place for smoothies</p>
           <p>So the TTG is summoned to the house of Megan, they all talk there for a while. Timo has the normal green mug which he plans to give to Martina since it's her birthday tomorrow (after 0:00 when prom ends). Fede paints his nails, and everyone is wearing quite elegant clothing.</p>
           <p>Timo thinks of painting his nails, but he decides not to after seeing that the nail paint contains trace amounts of <a href="events.html#lead">lead.</a></p>
           <p>Then they take some pictures</p>

           <p>Then they go to the prom. Megan forgot her ticket but luckily she had digital evidence of the ticket. So people were like dancing and stuff much like any normal prom. Milla and Timo don't like the loud music though.</p>
          <div class="img si30">

           <p>Juan and Coti were anounced prom king and queen, however Coti wasn't present so Bruno Taccone took the badge and crown instead. Sebas, Alex, and Fede dance in the dance floor while Milla goes to the second floor of the school where there is no music and it's more peaceful. The TTG starts looking for her. Milla finds Timo and they all go to the second floor where everything is more quiet.</p>

           <p>Also Lupi was sleeping in the prom I don't know why. Eventually Milla and Timo go down and they encounter Angie, Chiara, Salma, and Martina among others. Timo checks the time and gives Martina the Normal Green Mug as a birthday gift since it's 0:00 (he has been carrying it in his hand all this time). Martina liked it since she like drinking tea.</p>

           <p>Milla, Timo, and all the girls then go back to the gym, where the event was hosted. Timo and Milla immediately retreat because the music didn't get any less loud (it got louder)</p>
           <p>Eventually prom ends, the TTG goes to the theatre where a piano can be found. Timo plays the piano and Milla forshadows that she will learn how to play the piano some day. Then everyone goes to their homes, except those who go to the after prom. But I don't know what happened there.</p>

           <b>English</b>
           <p>Everyone reviewed for the final, trying to find the difference between post hoc and false cause (no one was capable). Someone said that post hoc uses the fact that the event happened in the past as innadecuate evidence to support a claim, while false cause uses the fact that both events happened to say that there is a correlation.</p>
           <b>Lunch</b>

            <b>June 17 2022</b>
            <p>The table tube gang was summoned to the original Rudy, the one in Montevideo shopping, to say goodbye to Megan and Milla who will be leaving and won't be in the school for the next chapter. All of the Table Tube Gang showed up except Josh but no one really knows where he is.</p>
            <p>The group went to Rudy, but Timo went to the arocena Rudy instead of the pocitos one so he arrived late. Alex asked through the Table Tube Gang groupchat what burger Timo wanted. He wanted a well done burger with everything, and Milla decides what fries he'd get, but Fede asked for a "Jugosa" instead for some reason (I don't know what point of the meat that is in english but it's not well done.)</p>
            <p>They talked about many, mainly reflecting on this year. Also, they sing happy birthday to Alex again (It's not his birthday).</p>

            <p>Everyone just danced and talked, Lupi and Timo ocassionally sat down to have a break from the party. They talked about how they only come to the party in case something interesting happens.</p>

              <li><p>Martina thanked Timo for the Special Normal Mug</p></li>
              <li><p>Many people where about to get kicked out of the party because they were not from the UAS(including the missionaries) but they let them in at the end</p></li>

              <li><p>Lupi commented on how he would actually go in the pool if it wasn't for the fact that he was not at home, so he does not have towels and he can't get in a car while he is wet. </p></li>
              <li><p>Everyone surrounded Lupi who was sitting outside with Timo, they formed a circle around him, excluding Timo. They where worried because Lupi was chilling, and Lupi never chills.

            <h2>The final finals + cata's party 20/06/2022</h2>
            <p>The last day of school, some had to finish finals and so they came to finish them. Timo did the english exam, San did the Math exam, Luca did the PE exam, and angie did the Computer Science exam. Timo and San finished immediately and saw each other. Then San went to visist jeff and talk with Nicole</p>
            <p>After that Luca entered the school and saw Timo, Luca needed to finish the PE final, but jeff canceled it, so he was just stuck there. After that recess started.</p>
            <p>Angie, San, and Luca talked while Timo played the piano and the guitar in music class.</p>
            <p>When recess ended, Jeff told Luca and San to do an essay about sports. They went to the library and the to the computer class where San watched a movie. Meanwhile Timo talked to Joaquin Baranzano the music teacher about how the destruction of exosystems affects the soundsacpe of places.</p>
            <p>Timo then went to Jeff to see where Luca and San were, aswell as to claim his money from the bet. Jeff didn't give him money, instead he gave Timo a piece of brownie, a chocolate, and a kitkat. Jeff and Timo talked and Jeff told Timo that San and Luca where in the library, so Timo went there, but they where in the computer class, San was watching a movie, angie was "doing" the computer science final, and Luca was playing games on his phone(doing the PE essay). Timo gave Luca and San the kitkat from Jeff. San tried to plug in two headphones so that Timo could also listen to the movie he was watching, he googled how to make 2 headphones play sound, and the answer that google gave him was "Buy a headphone splitter".</p>
            <p>Timo challenged San to a game of ping pong, they went to ask Helen if they could, but Helen told them to wait a bit since many people hadn't finished thei exam yet. Luca and San went upstairs and walked around, while Timo went to Baranzano's class to play the guitar, Connor and Alesandro where in the class, and they wanted to play ping pong since they already finished their final, however Baranzano didn't like the idea since he didn't think the principal would let them.</p>
            <p>Timo told them to wait until an hour of the final had passed, and then they would be allowed to play ping pong, Baranzano agreed. Timo played the Guitar while everyone else waited, and then Connor and Alesandro went to play ping pong. Luca and San saw them playing and they started to play aswell.</p>
            <p>Timo joined them.</p>
            <b>FINAL PING PONG MATCHES OF WEA</b>
            <ol>
              <li>San was about to win but then Luca did an epic comeback</li>
              <li>Luca destroyed Timo</li>
              <li>Luca destroyed San</li>
              <li>Timo and Luca did an epic match to 21. Luca started off with the upper hand, but Timo started reaching him, the end was very close, Timo was about to win, but Luca won at the end</li>
              <li>Timo played San who was tired of losing, and San lost again</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Luca was first, Timo was second, and San was third.</p>
            <p>And after that, the final actual day is over.</p>
            <h2>Cata's party</h2>
            <b>What happened</b>
            <p>Not very interesting party, it was pretty lame. So let's summarize it in a flash of events</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Lucas came and waited for Timo</li>
              <li>Lucas recieved a message that Timo forgot his money</li>
              <li>Lucas payed for Timo</li>
              <li>Lucas realised he lost his Lon Tennis card</li>
              <li>Lucas also realised he was really tired and was going to get bored in this party</li>
              <li>Lucas and Timo had a similar discussion to the one that Lupi and Timo had at fede's party, about how these parties are kinda lame unless you get high or drunk, or are very social</li>
              <li>Lucas realised that he was going to have no fun at this party</li>
              <li>Lucas and Timo went to the exit where they saw the girls coming in, including Vale</li>
              <li>Lucas told Timo that he would leave because the party was too lame for him, Timo understood.</li>
              <li>Lucas told Timo that if anyone asked where he had gone, to tell them that he forgot something and that he may come back, though he wouldn't, Timo agreed.</li>
              <li>Timo told him the events that happened earlier that day in the final day.</li>
              <li>After that Lucas left</li>
              <li>Timo went back, but he did not know what to do, dancing was not for him, and none of the people he would usually talk to where there, so he kinda just sat there.</li>
              <li>Timo was tired and couldn't breathe correctly to counter the cold as he usually does, so he got cold and was forced to go inside with the loud music.</li>
              <li>The rest of the people where just dancing and talking</li>
              <li>Towards the end, the group talked a bit about the IB. Someone from the class of 2022 who took physics HL was talking about how he regretted doing so.</li>
              <li>After that Timo and Mili left, as everyone continued doing what people do at parties</li>
              <p>Also Megan confirms that she is in possesion of the Tube</p>

            <p>Dani and Lupi, and maybe others had to finish exams that they couldn't do because they where absent, or didn't finish them, this is the final day any one can possibly be in the UAS school.</p>
           </li>
       </ul>
       <b>Review Days</b>
       <p>In the review days, almost no one showed up most of the time, because of the sickness, there was sickness going around. Now here are the review days</p>

      <h3>Ending</h3>
      <p>The last party was terrible in my opinion, I prefer fede's party, it was cooler and more interesting. Now that it all ended, I must say, what a weird era this was, so many things changed. I started this project kind of late now that I think about it, like, the group has only 2 more years left, the IB years, that means only 4 more chapters of this time line, or something like that. Anyways, there was no actually cool party, not yet but if there any party in the future, I will note it down here</p>
      <b>super cool party</b>
      <p>No</p>
      <h3>Statistics and values</h3>
      <p><b>Note:</b>This where not calculated in a reliable way at all, Timo just put random stuff in a calculator and this is what he got</p>

        <p>This was a very interesting chapter. It got it's name because since the very beginning, weird things started happening, these events are what defined the era. This weirdness slowed down as time progressed, but it never came to a stop. Also the IB started to was approaching, which caused stress. Everyone warned the group about IB, how stressful and how much work they will have to do. Finally, the new students. There where many new students, including people like Alex, Mili, and Chiara who are really fun to have around, there where also some old students that came back, like which were Marina and Martina, and an even older student that was in the group in elementary, Nicole. All of these people where really cool and added a lot to the atmosphere of the class. It has been quite long since the group last had so many new students. Also, people are leaving</p>
        <b>Fare well</b>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="others.html#marina">Marina</a> who will go to the US, but won't come back this time.</li>
          <li> <a href="others.html#megan">Megan</a> who will be going to north carolina, taking the tube with her</li>
          <li><a href="others.html#milla">Milla</a> who will be going back to finland</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is sad that Marina will be leaving, she brings a really positive energy to the class, an energy that will be scarce. Since in the next chapter, IB will start, the class has been warned about how incredibly arduous and stressful IB will be. Everyone in the class took English Language and Literature, since coyle will be leaving and she is the one that did only literature. Also, Megan and Milla are leaving, with so many members gone from the Table Tube Gang, the group might cease to exist, and another group might be formed in its place, or maybe not.</p>
        
        <p>A new principal is coming, his name is Doug Murphy, perhaps changes will be made, perhaps some will improve conditions, or perhaps they will damage the class's experience, only time will tell. Finally for new students, the son of Doug Murphy, Chad Murphy will join the class. And perhaps other new students will aswell. But one thing is for sure, whatever awaits next chapter, it will be a hell of a ride</p>

          <p><b>26/06/2022:</b>Martina wanted to play something, then Dani and Timo played pvp legacy like the old times in quarintine, after that Mati joined and told Timo to download fallguys, which took a very long time</p>
          <p>In that time, Mati showed Timo a new game that was similar to rocket league but with rollers. Then Lupi arrived and he went against Timo in a pvp legacy fight, however Timo's lag made the game unplayable, since he was also installing fall guys at the samw time.</p>
          <p>Lupi played fall guys, he was really good at it, then mati left. After waiting forl like 50 more minutes, Lupi, Mati, and Timo played fall guys, although mati had to leave, the Dani joined, Dani almost won a fall guys game, but he lost against one other person, Timo didn't even get close to winning. Martina Joined, anounced here head hurt, and left. Then the group played more fall guys until they got bored and started watching videos about really strong people.</p>
          <p>Then Martina joined again and started showing all of the animes she was planning to watch. Then everyone watched disturbing videos by some youtuber. Martina left.</p>
          <p>Timo told Dani about the 48 laws of power. Then Timo made Dani play a game about trust and the mathematics behind trust, which Dani found very interesting. The game use mathematics to explain trust, it reached the conclusion that the law "an eye for an eye" works pretty well.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Dani and Lupi started discussing the problems with gangs in the united states, and how they are terrible and the people in them don't know any better and stuff like that. Then they started rating different US states. Mati joined, Timo left, and Martina also joined. Martina and Matias started trying to defeat a boss in genshin impact while dani and lupi continued to rate states</p>
          <p>After that, the people played Roblox. They played a game about a tall man that was trying to kill them. Timo was having serious technological delay problems, and thus was struggling to move. Everyone went inside a castle, where they had to abandon Timo who was having a seizure so he could not join them. After that the team found itself in a some corridors, where Timo found the tall man, and he got teleported to the team.</p>
          <p>Timo found a way to stabilize his seizures, but can't do sharp turns. The team finished the game.</p>
          <p>After that the team played a version of the backrooms, everyone had 4 lives. In the first stage, Mati died twice, and everyone else died once. Dani left since he did not like scary games.</p>
          <p>Timo ran so far out that the scribble monster could not get him, then he found the stairs and everyone got teleported to the second stage</p>
          <p>The second stage was flooded and there was a tentacle monster going around the place, the team had to find valves and turn them. Everyone died once to the monster. After like 10 minutes, the team was only missing one valve, until Timo found it and everyone got teleported to stage 3</p>
          <p>There was a big hallway, the hallway had signs that said that the monster from this stage, can only hear. But the monster always lingered around waiting for people to move, so it was really hard not to die. The team needed to find a key, and Martina did. But both Timo and Martina died after that. Timo then died again because he thought he could outspeed the monster. Only Mati and Martina was left, however, Mati was inmmortal, since he could bribe god with robux.</p>
          <p>Despite Mati's inmmortality, the team lost, and could not escape the third stage.</p>
          <p>Then, Mati Dani and Timo discussed if they would rather know stuff, or not know stuff. Which Dani connected to the idea of real and imaginary numbers, and the complex plane. Dani decided to be a math teacher, and he explained to timo what the complex plane was, and what sine wave where, and what division by 0 was. Timo then had a sine wave playing in the background.</p>
          <p>Martina asked Dani what his deepest darkest secret was, but Dani was too uninteresting to have a deepest darkest secret, Martina and Timo tried to get a secret out of Dani for 1 hour straight, then Martina talked about a rapping anime show and anime tropes for 40 minutes.</p>
          <p>Dani hated all of Martina's explanation.</p>

          <b>27/06/2022</b>
          <p>Mati and Dani where in a call. Mati was playing roller champions while Dani was just there. Then Timo and Martina joined, and they started once again playing the scary backrooms roblox game, this time, they wanted to be able to complete it. They got really close, but everyone died in a level where to giant chased people around a parking lot.a</p>

          <b>28/06/2022</b>
          <p>Mati and Timo where talking about genshin impact, when ethan joined, then they started talking even more about genshin impact when Martina joined. Then they started talking about anime, while everyone was preparing to play roblox, suddenly, Timo had to go to deliver cookies, so everyone waited for him.</p>
          <p>When he came back, Dani had joined the call, then everyone but Dani played a very bad horror game. Then they played many horror games, some of which where almost scary. They got bored, Martina and Ethan played anime rythm games while Mati and Timo just did nothing, then everyone left.</p>

          <b>30/06/2022: Unexpected occurences</b>
          <p>Martina wanted to do something, and so did Dani and Timo.</p>
          <p>Timo said that he was just eating an ice cream, which Dani replied to by saying that he would combine it with milk and protein powder for body building. Timo explained how that would be an act of disrespect to the creator of the ice-cream.</p>
          <p>When everyone joined the voice call, they talked about the body. And farming, they spent a lot of time talking about random stuff, like names and tancients in names(or something like that) and then Martina drew Daniel and herself.</p>
          <p>Then Timo asked her what her favorite weapon is, which she said was a polearm(longer spear). Timo agreed with this statement saying that most people would say that swords are better, but they would be wrong since spears are lighter and have more range.</p>
          <p>Martina started showing Timo some epic anime battles involving spears, guns, swords, and a bit of everything, the she showed Timo some characters. Dani made negative comments towards anime which lead to an argument.</p>
          <p>Martina and Matias have been making mean-spirited jokes towards Dani, and Dani has been retaliating by making mean spirited comments about the other person. They fought and they said that Dani was very mean, and a dick, while Dani was just confused, and Timo was trying to fix this mess.</p>
          <p>After that Martina went to watch anime and Mati went to sleep</p>
          <p>However Dani and Timo stayed, and they talked about deep topics</p>

            <h3>Dani and Timo's deep talks</h3>
            <b>Starring... Dani, and Timo, talking about deep topics</b>
            <b>Firts Topic: The discussion</b>
            <p>Dani asked Timo about his opinions on the discussion they just had. Dani felt like he just go crucified by Martina for no reason. Timo explained that sometimes his comments can come off as rude even if they are meant to be constructive criticism. Dani replied saying that Martina and Matias also act rude towards him. Timo concluded that this was nothing but a back and forth cycle of rudeness, and that the only possible solution is to talk it out</p>
            <b>IB Predictions</b>
            <p>Dani asked for another topic, Timo asked Dani "What are youre predictions for the IB" he said that at the beginning it was going to be really stressful, but then everyone would get used to it. Timo asked Dani if he believed that Timo was capable of taking physics, Dani said that Timo was definately smart enouph but lacked the concientiousness, which he thought was a really easy fix, but Timo disagreed entirely, saying it was immposible to get a lot of repetitive easy work done. Dani said that all Timo needed was motivation, Timo's only true motivation is to help other people, but he struggled to use that as a motivation to work. Dani told Timo about the feeling that someone gets when they know the work they did has payed off, a feeling in your chest full of satisfactino. Timo says he never felt such a thing, and he would make it his goal, to feel it.</p>
            <b>Smartness in the class</b>
            <p>Dani asked for another topic, Timo asked Dani who he thought in the class was smart. Dani said what was expected, but Timo informed Dani that the Table Tube Gang members are actually smarter than what they might first appear. Timo told Dani about the tales of the table tube gang, and it's stories, and the existential discussions, and the science realted ones. Dani did not expect that group to be that smart.</p>
            <b>Bruno</b>
            <p>But Timo knew that there was a person that could be talked about for hours, Bruno Nario. Timo said to Dani that Bruno may sometimes come off as conceited, that he believes he is better than others just because he is more opened minded. Dani actually agreed, to Timo's surprise. Remarking how he isolates himself from the class, isolating himself in his own good morality bubble.</p>
            <b>Daniel analyses beauty</b>
            <p>Timo wanted to talk about aesthetics, the philosphy behind the beauty in things, however Dani misunderstood and thought he wanted to talk about what humans find attractive. Dani went on a MASSIVE tangent about what facial features make a man more attractive. He taught Timo about the red pill, the blue pill, and the surprise black pill. Then Dani showed some videos to Timo, about a guy who was one of the most sexist, and controversial people Timo has ever heard, however, Timo listened with an open mind. He agreed on approximately nothing of what the man was saying. Apparently Dani analyses people a lot. Specially their facial features, the angles of the chin the eyebrows the ratio of the neck, literally everything. He is kinda obsessed.</p>
            <b>Test Results</b>
            <p>Timo and Dani discussed the ocean test results of the class, apparently, Timo is the most open, and the most agreeale of the class, which he found surprising, since he thought that Marina would be more agreeable. The highest neurotism goes to Mati and Martina which is ironic since those where the two other people in the group. Dani believed that Bruno 100% faked all of his scores in that test in order to look cooloer. After that they talked about THE JOKE with Alex, to prove how Alex was incredibly naive, but suddenly Timo's lights went out and the conversation ended abrubtly</p>

            <p>Also, Dani uses the word "ocilations" a lot, he always finds a way to use it. He really likes that word.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Someday today, Technoblade ( a minecraft youtuber that Dani and Timo watched a lot during the quarinting) died. I think anyways I'm not sure. It's revealed that his name was Alex and not Dave.</p>

          <b>01/07/2022</b>
          <p>Timo joined a call and Dani just happened to check his discord screen like 5 seconds later and saw Timo, so he joined. They talked about Techno's death, Timo was kinda sad becayse of Techno's death, while Dani was not moved at all, Dani expereinced the deaths of many known celebrities, specially rappers.</p>
          <p>After that they talked a bit more about blue, red, and black pills, Timo offered a new kind of pill, the white pill. Dani liked the red pill because it meant acknowledging that beauty matters in society, and taking action to adjust yourself to society's beauty standards. Timo's suggested pill was acknowledging that beauty matters, and changing society instead of changing yourself. Dani understood how this new pill could exist, but he thought that changing society was immposible, Timo disagreed.</p>
          <p>After that They talked about Dani's personality test, and Dani and Timo discovered that they are actually opposites, Timo had the highest agreeablness but lowest concientiousness, and Dani had highest concientiousness but lowest agreeablness. Both of them had high openness however which means that they are open minded. Dani pointed out how the difference between their personalities could be seen in how Timo always takes someone's side and tries to help them while Dani doesn't.</p>
          <p>Then Mati joined and gave Timo advise on how to become stronger, and finally, everyone pinned random stuff onto the channel, specially out of context quotes like "I'll show you mine if you show me yours".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2/7/2022</b>
          <p>Mati tried summoning the group, however he was unsuccesful, then, Timo joined, and once again, Mati just happened to look at the screen and he joined, then they talked about many things like ice-cream or how Dani was stupid for not wanting to join the call. Then they started showing their music to each other and then they left.</p>
          <b>Other events that day</b>
          <p>Fede was feeling bad about how the class was making many transphobic and just overall lgbt-phobic. He posted a story asking for positive stuff in instagram and people cheered him up.</p>

          <b>Why install Locket</b>
          <p>Locket Widget is the iPhone app everyone can't stop talking about, and while there's no doubt the app is popular, is it safe to use? Online security is a top-of-mind issue more so than ever before. As people spend an increasing amount of time online and keep sharing more data about themselves, taking digital privacy seriously quickly becomes a necessity. Companies experience data breaches, bad actors run countless online scams, and these things show no signs of slowing down any time soon. Locket is a pretty harmless app. Users download it, add the widget to their home screen, and then use that widfet to share photos to friends' home screens. It can also be easy to assume that locket is safer than sharing pictures in snapchat or Twitter. Rather than uploading a photo to a platform of users, images sent with Locket can only be shared with up to five, does that make locket safe? Yes</p>
          <p>Looking at Locket's privacy policy, the app is very upfront about the type of data it collects. All Locket users are required to enter their phone number and name to "identify you to other Locket users." Locket also requests that people share their contacts with the app. This is done to help people quickly invite other friends/family to join their Locket network. Regarding contact information, Locket says it will "never save your contacts and never send text messages to your friends without your explicit permission." And, of course, Locket also collects photo data. The app's privacy policy primarily focuses on how photos work between users. Photos sent to a friend's Locket widget are available immediately, and shared photos can't be deleted from the other person's widget. Locket encourages users to "be careful" about the types of photos users share and notes that it "works hard to keep [photo] data private and secure."</p>
          <p>For these reasons you will also protect the flying squirrel population because when you are in the toilet spending time in locket widget -it- dries and you dont need to waste paper wiping you know. Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) are the only two native flying squirrel species found in North America. They are both gray-brown, but the northern flying squirrel has belly fur that is gray at the base, and for the southern flying squirrel the belly fur is all white. Size is another way to tell northern and southern flying squirrels apart. The southern species is smaller, about 8 to 10 inches in length. Northern flying squirrels are 10 to 12 inches long. Flying squirrels might more appropriately be called “gliding squirrels” because they aren’t capable of true powered flight that a bird or a bat can do. Flying squirrels glide.</p>
          <p>They have a special membrane between their front and back legs that allows them to glide through the air between trees. When a flying squirrel wants to travel to another tree without touching the ground, it launches itself from a high branch and spreads out its limbs so the gliding membrane is exposed. It uses slight movements of the legs to steer, and the tail acts as a brake upon reaching its destination. Flying squirrels can cover more than 150 feet in a single glide. The southern flying squirrel is found throughout the eastern United States, from Maine south to Florida and west from Minnesota south to Texas. The northern flying squirrel has a much patchier distribution, but is found primarily in the Northeast, along the West Coast, and into Idaho and Montana. Flying squirrels live in deciduous and coniferous forests and woodlands. They make their homes in snags, woodpecker holes, nest boxes, and abandoned nests of birds and other squirrels.</p>
          <p>Sometimes multiple squirrels will nest together to keep warm in the winter. Thanks to their superb gliding abilities, flying squirrels are great escape artists. Once a flying squirrel lands on a tree trunk following a flight, it promptly scurries to the other side of the trunk to avoid any predators that may have followed it. Nevertheless, owls, hawks, tree snakes, and climbing mammals frequently manage to catch and consume these tiny rodents. When the flying squirrel population is secured you will also protect humans because when there is squirrels left humans dont feel the need to replecate them. Humans have long sought to replicate the flying squirrel’s gliding abilities. Base jumpers and skydivers have developed a special suit that mimics the flying squirrel. The suit works to slow their descent and allows them to maneuver through the air. This lind of actions cause lots of deaths and you surely dont want people to die dont you?</p>
          <p>oh i forgot to add that since u dont now need to use toilet paper they dont need to cut down so many trees tl make paper and so the flyind squirrels homes are not destroyed sibce they build nests to trees</p>

          <p>Timo finds a painting by one of Ms Ambrois' (The previous art teacher) relatives. He talks to her through instagram. He also informs the table tube gang about this. The Table Tube Gang, specially fede, found it craze that Timo just texted her.</p>

          <b>Ambassador orientation</b>
          <p>New students are introduced to the school, the new students are Chad Alexander Murphy, Sofia Castellano(I will call her Sofe to not get her confused with Sofia Ugarte), and Eitoku. All of them seem nice. Orientation was carried out by Fede and Mati, Timo could not get there in time.</p>

          <p>After that same day, Mati, Dani, Timo, and Martina joined a call in discord in which Mati and Martina played Valorant while Dani and Timo played chess. Timo lied to Dani about having gone to the ambassador orientation day. Fede gave Timo all the names of the new students so Mati was confused as to how Timo knew about the new students since he though (correctly) that Timo wasn't there.</p>

          <p>Fede talks about how Krugerands (The most stable currency from a show called Russian Doll) could break the fabric of space time so they shouldn't be trusted to anyone from the TTG</p>
          <p>On the topic of relativity, Ethan and his dad watched interstellar. His dad didn't believe time dilation is real so he asked if anyone could explain it to his dad. Timo did, basically if time dilation didn't happen gravity wouldn't happen either.</p>
