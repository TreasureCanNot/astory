        <b>Table tube gang</b>
        <p>Milla, Megan, Timo, and Fede were the only ones left from the Back to the Bench group. Fede and Timo where embassadors who helped integrate Josh and Sebas to the school, they became friends and thus Josh and Sebas joined the remaining members of the Back to the Bench group.</p>
        <p>Instead of going to a far away bench, this group sat on a normal blue Table. The table had a tube in the middle, and this tube was only being held by one screw. The group wanted to perform a "devious lick" and they decided to steal the tube. Through the power of dedication, teamwork, and friendship, the team managed to take that tube out of the table. This was an amazing accomplishment. Josh put the Tube in his locker and that is how the name "Table Tube Gang" came to be.</p>
        <b>Real High School</b>
        <p>TTG was created during <a href="events.html#rhs">Real High School</a>. The group talks about very random stupid stuff. Sebas created many inside jokes about random stuff such as lean or skinwalkers.</p>
        <b>Weird Era Adventure</b>
        <p>In <a href="events.html#wea">Weird Era Adventure</a> Alex joined the group. The group continued its tradition of talking about random stupid stuff and inside jokes. However jokes became more elaborate. An example is <a href="events.html#thejoke">THE JOKE</a>, <a href="events.html#thelore">The Lore</a> and others. The group also started having deeper philosofical and scientific discussions, such as when they talked about what could happen after death, the meaning of life, and Einsteins theory of general relativity. For some reason Josh wasn't a huge part of the table tube gang during Weird Era Adventure. Also approaching the end of Weird Era Adventure, Ethan joined the Table Tube Gang and he was added to the instagram group.</p>
        <b>The Skinwalker and Jesus leave</b>
        <p>Megan and Milla left after Weird Era Adventure, also Megan stole The Tube from Josh's locker. Despite this, the Table Tube Gang still often talks through the instagram groupcaht that they have.All members except Alex and Ethan often use this groupchat.</p>

        <b>Origin</b>
        <p>Timo, Sebas, Fede, Ethan, and Alex were the remaining members of the Table Tube Gang after Milla and Megan left to finland and north carolina respectively. However new students came, these new students are Sofe, Chad, and えいとく (Eitoku). Lupi also became friends with Alex and Timo since they go to volleyball practices together. Furthermore, Lupi, Eitoku, Alex, Chad and Sebas all have Spanish B with Rodri and they have fun in that class</p>
        <p>This group could not be called the Table Tube Gang because Megan stole the tube, and thus it was no longer in their posession. Sebas and Timo came up with the name "The Wander Warblers Contingent". The logic is supposed to be that this group always "wanders" off topic. Timo just liked the warbler bird, and Sebas liked the word "Contingent"</p>
        <b>Impending Sudden Times</b>
        <p>Lucas and a kid named Alejandro (from the class of 2025) joined the group. Also Bruno joined the group aswell, there is definately far too many people in this group right now. The group was starting to dismantle, and after Eitoku's fall I think its safe to say that this group didn't really exist anymore.</p>

            <p>Sebas had a whatsapp groupchat with some old friends, and he added Megan, Milla, and Timo to this group. The name of the groupchat was "Kill eddie from neck" and I didn't really understand what that meant.</p>
            <p>Timo then decides to post all of the 4 and 5 leafed clovers he usually finds. He then told everyone to try to find a 4-leafed clover and he re-named the group to "The Grass Starers since thats what they would be doing.</p>
            <p>Eitoku was interested in trying to find 4-leafed clovers so he got joined to the group.</p>
            <p>Sebas and Milla were the only ones who succesfuly found a 4-leafed clover. Milla found a dried out 4-leafed clover.</p>
