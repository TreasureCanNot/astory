        <p>The cruelness of humanity attacked a poor pigeon leaving it defenseless at the center of a road. The pigeon struggles to survive as the cars pass mercilessly fast. It can't seem to fly for its wing must be damaged. The situation catches Timo's attention and he immdeiately gets off his car to go and help the pigeon. Timo rushes to the middle of the street and picks up the creature, but it was too late. The pigeon's head was wide open, its death is imminent. With the its last breath and its withstood damage, the pigeon uttered to him its name, and out of its open head flowed stories and knowledge. Secrets reified by ignorance, myths and legends too powerful to voice, they spilled like blood all over Timo's hands as he rested clavio in a quieter place. Then clavio took off.</p>

        <p>Also it's Mili's Birthday. She has been saying that every day is her birthday for all of 2023 but today it's actually her birthday... I think</p>

        <p><b>Date:</b>19/01/2024</p>
        <p><b>Climate:</b>Sunny and Windy</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b>Rudy's and the Montevideo Park</p>
        <br>
        <p>Timo, Fede, and Sebas go to Rudy and get burgers, however Fede and Sebas arrived late so they all ask for a take out. Sebas cut his hair, and Fede dyed his hair blonde the other day.</p>
        <p>Fede hanged out with Alex's girlfriend yesterday and she also knows about Fede's hair.</p>
        <div class="img si37">
          <img src="new/19,1,2024/rudy.jpg" class="ing">
          <p class="itg">Rudy</p>
        </div>
        <p>They walk to a place to eat the burger and then they go to an ice-cream place where they eat ice-cream, they discuss languages, concluding English is more useful but spanish has more colourful vocabulary. They also discuss country's anthems, Sebas only knows the part of the German anthem that was removed, saying it was the catchiest part.</p>
        <p>Then they go to a park, on the way there they talk about people in the class and how there are a lot of hot boys in the class. Fede was saying something about girls being mid and high but the boys are all high.</p>
        <p>They pass through some grasslands, and suddenly a huge swarm of mosquitoes envelopes them and starts attacking, they start running to get off the swarm, once they got out, they were still covered and had to remove many. even Timo's ewheel was full of mosquitoes.</p>
        <div class="img si35">
          <img src="new/19,1,2024/mosquitoes.jpg" class="ing">
          <p class="itg">Mosquito</p>
        </div>
        <p>After that attack, they go to a nearby bench and apply mosquito repelent. I don't remember what they talked about at first, but Timo brought up the topic of moss and how there is male and female moss. Sebas then concluded moss has semen, which is true. Fede started talking about Sex education and the lack thereof in the school.</p>
        <p>Fede then proceeded to educate them in several sex facts that I chose not to remember. The Sebas asked Fede some questions about gay sex like how does one decide who goes on top or who goes on bottom. Fede goes in full detail about it.</p>
        <p>They wonder how the conversation got to this and Timo says that unfortunately he started it with moss.</p>
        <p>Sebas then brings up Dani, and how Dani has been texting him like 4 times per week. Then he shows a text that Dani sent him about a dream he had. They were on a bus and Dani said "Hey no homo but you looking fine", and Fede almost died. He started theorising that Dani is actually gay and he has repressed it and he is in denial. Sebas said that he can't imagine Dani with a woman, and Timo said that Dani can be very easily misunderstood. Fede said that Dani might actually be bi because he thinks that he had something for Marina as proven by the <a href="#buttworkout">emails</a> Dani had sent her</p>
        <p>So then they talk about people in class and relationships.</p>
        <b>Conclusions</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Mati would beat his wife(Fede claims)</li>
          <li>Lupi would get in fights with whoever he marries(He gets in discussions and arguments with the girls in the class very often)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those are the only ones I remember.</p>
        <p>They talk about rizz, Sebas apparently has unspoken rizz, he talks about how in peru he was with this woman that was married to some australian man. The woman giggled at him and he didn't like that. The next day Sebas' mother told him that woman had said if she wasn't married she woudlve married Sebas, or something like that.</p>
        <p>Timo found it kind of weird but Fede was proud, "rizz is rizz". They also mention how Eitoku has insane rizz. "Eitoku pulls!"-Fede. Sebas says that he will soon have to go to the gym, he asks Timo if he had done anything interesting. Timo tells him 2 things.</p>
        <p>That he started going to the gym, pull push legs. And Sebas is surprised that Timo is doing actual weights.</p>
        <p>And about a dream about how they went to a haunted hotel from Carrasco, it had a restaurant, and after escaping it, they were chased by the staff. The hotel was somewhere in positos, but it was the only tall buidling, as if the city hadn't been built yet and that hotel was the first actual building. Sebas remarks that there used to be a hotel near, but it was demolished, he unfortunately does not know if it was haunted or not.</p>
        <p>Finaly, Timo leaves his tag, and Fede writes some song lyrics. Sebas says that Timos tag is better than his signature and Timo doesn't like that. And they leave after that. Sebas goes to the gym and Fede somewhere else.</p>

        <p><b>Location:</b>Uruguayan American School, Obra, and Chiara's house</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today is orientation day, new students are assigned ambassadors that guide them through the school. Unfrotunately there are no new students, it's not surprising since this class is about to graduate. Mati, Eitoku and Timo come to the school anyways to assist. Federico Berman talks to Timo and Mati about what they did in the vacations while Ms Nina introduces the school to the new students. Lara is also there. Mati later says that Federico Berman seemed like a cool guy.</p>
        <p>Then they go on a tour of the school. The cafeteria is still under construction, Timo sneaked in and took the following pictures.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Eitoku and Mati help people with computers while Timo goes to talk to Mr Turner about the ToK essay that he failed. Turner says that it was an issue of citation and but the content was actually good.</p>
        <div class="img si40">

        </div>
        <p>Meanwhile Eitoku and Mati are struggling to help a new student input his passwords to the accounts correctly.</p>
        <p>Timo leaves because it appears there is nothing left to do. He goes to buy an ice-cream. He has a 2-for-one deal with Itau but he doesn't want the second ice-cream. The cashier offers him to come get the second ice-cream some other time. She writes it on the receipt.</p>
        <p>Then Timo goes to obra and to his surprise he finds Chiara, Mati, and Eitoku. They sat down together and talked about stuff while they ate pokebowls.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How everyone saw Timo on the ewheel while passing through San Nicolas.</li>
          <li>Chiara started journaling because she felt lonely in the vacations</li>
          <li>Eitoku got to go to japan and it war real fun for him. He got a ring that changes colour depending on who wears it and a neclace that has the phrase "I love you" in many different languages. Timo and Chiara first read "I love chi" because they were looking at it the wrong way round.</li>
          <li>They talk about how Chiara and Santino are doing "Good *Thumbs up*"-Chiara. Chiara mentions how Santino used the word "Sass" with Chiara which is very uncharacteristic of him.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chiara wants an ice-cream, but she wants someone to accompany her to go to Fredo. Timo remembers that he has the 2 for 1 receipt and he gives it to Chiara.</p>
        <p>So they eat ice-cream. Eitoku shows Timo the colour changing ring, Timo is purple, Eitoku is green, and Mati is also green.</p>
        <p>They talk about origami's aswell. Eitoku informs that origami is the paper, and the bird thing that people do is actually called a つる (a crane written in japanese, pronounces "tsuru").</p>
        <p>Then Mati and Eitoku go to Chiara's house, they said that Martina might join them. And Timo left.</p>
