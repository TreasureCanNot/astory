  <!-- NOTE: 
  <ol>
  
    <li><b>Friendship Power School - By Timoteo Marcaida:</b>A story about what if the class had SuperPowers, it was kinda like My Hero Acedemia, however this book was written before My Hero Academia even existed. The class trains normally when suddenly an evil entity appears and starts threatening their lives with a powerful gun. The team went to investigate an explosion in the middle of the night caused by the same villain. The team saw just how powerful the villain was. Ioel charged his super attack but then the villain whose name was Trevil decided to leave. The team found people that where hurt, one of them was named Valiteo and had snow powers, she joined the team. The next day the Timo decided he needed to assemble a big team of people capable of forfending Trevil's evil. So he went to find more people, he found Lola, and then went to find another person who was in Argentina called, Gonzalo. That is where it ends because it is not finished.</li>
