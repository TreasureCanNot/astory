      <p>The Chaos Prevention Agency (CPA) is tasked for making sure that society changes as little as possible to avoid chaos and conserve normalcy. In order to prevent chaos, they are tasked to deal with anything that is supernatural or anything that could cause significant change in the structure of the current society. In the story, they are the enemies of the TTG</p>
      <p>The CPA supercomputers have calculated that there are many chances that the world will end soon, in every single possibility, the TTG is the main cause of the end of the world. Although some humans always survive, to prevent the end of the world, the CPA fights agains the TTG to forfend this.</p>
      <p class="duh" style="font-size:18px; color:rgb(245, 241, 108);"> But not really, Table Tube Gang had made many jokes that eventually ended up having their own lore. It all started with Timo being a wizard, then Sebas having lived through times in history, then Megan being a witch, and eventually, the jokes had their own lore. There was a joke were the Table Tube Gang was going to solve all problems in the world, by destroying it, and reubuilding it better, similar to farenheit 451, a complete overhaul. But Fede said the world would probably have an organization that would prevent that from happening, hence, the CPA vs the TTG. This website is more from the perspective of the CPA</p>

      <b>Souls and Conciousness</b>
      <p>This is my logic to how souls and magic could work in a fictitious world. If you ignore the magic this is actually my current theory as to how real souls work.</p>
      <p>A complex system + a soul = emotions and conciousness. So a brain or a complex enouph computer +  a soul gets conciousness and emotions. GOod</p>
      <p>Souls have 2 parts, the Soul core, and the Soul stuff, the Soul core is indestructable. It is also constant source of Soul stuff. That does violate the law of conservation of energy but shhhhh this is fiction. The soul core is what creates conciousness and emotions when combined with a complex algorithm or system, it also controls the soul stuff</p>
      <p>The Soul stuff can transform Common Energy into Active Energy, and create spells from it. I will explain that in the future</p>
      <p><b><b>Magic (AKA: the future)</b></b></p>
      <i>Common energy</i>
      <p>Common Energy is energy created by Magic Stones. Common Energy is found in the common field and all Common Energy is the same. The most efficient way of using Common Energy is if a soul uses the soul stuff to transform the Common Energy into Active Energy.</p>
      <i>Active Energy</i>
      <p>Active Energy is energy that can be used cause different kinds of physical phenomena. This means that Active Energy can be converted into any type of Energy, including matter. Active Energy can have many interactions with other fields which is what allows it to control other fields. An example is how Active Energy can have an electromagnetic charge, this would allow someone to use Active Energy to create electromagnetic fields and stuff like that. The characteristics of Active Energy are dependent on whoever turned the common energy into the active energy, AKA the user/wizard. Different combinations of these characteristics can make literally anything possible, and that is how I justify anything being possible. The infinite amount of possible characteristics like charges and stuff allow me to make up an explanation for how any possible spell could possible work.</p>
      <b>Soul Affinities</b>
      <p>Some souls might find it easier to use certain characteristics of the Active Field than others. For example there might be a soul that can make Active Energy easily increase the inner kinetic energy of particles(increase the temperture), this soul could be said to have a Pyrolytic Affinity. Another soul might find it easier to apply forces to objects, this soul could be said to have a Kinetic Affinity, another soul finds it easier to read people's minds, this could be described as a psychologic affinity (The list is infinite)</p>
      <p>(Almost)All souls are capable of doing everything, but the Magic user(or wizard) will have trouble doing some things depending on their soul affinity.</p>
      <b>What do you mean Almost all souls</b>
      <p>Timo's soul differnt, I'll show you. But first we have to introduce a complicated topic.</p>
      <p><b>Simple Souls</b></p>
      <p>When the universe needs them, simple souls will appear. Simple souls have the ability to any energy to it's most stable form. This form is common energy. This is done through something that I call the simple spell. That is all you really need to know, but I am going to explain a bit more, you can skip to the next paragraph if you want. So the activation energy for any form of energy to revert to it's most stable form is too high, and the simple spell is a catalyst for this occurence. Soul and soul stuff are at the same level of stability as the common energy so they aren't affected by it. Also, to turn anything but active energy into common energy you need a significantly strong simple spell.</p>
      <p>Another characteristic of simple souls, is that they always have an affinity that allows them to use Active Energy in ways that fundamentally change the world. Common Affinities are like people being capable of moving stuff, vibrating stuff, heating up stuff, kinetic affinities are common. Then there are more complex affinities like psychological affinities or the affinity of turning into animals. But then there are fundamental abilities like the ability to bend space time, the ability to manipulate probability, the ability to change different forms of energy. These fundamental ways of using Active Energy are only seen in simple souls. </p>
      <p>This is why simple souls are usually accompanied with a tiny description of what they can do. For example: <i>The Simple Soul of Probability</i> is capable of manipulating the probabilities of fundamental particles doing something, thus gaining control of things such as entropy. <i>The Simple Soul of Relativity</i> is capable of of bending spacetime to it's will which allows it to create gravitational fields, additionally they are capable of creating the opposite effect of gravity which would repel instead of attract. You get it</p>
      <p>An important note is that even though simple souls might seem more powerful, they aren't. The "power" of something is still limited by the amount of Common Energy that they can convert into Active Energy in a certain amount of time.</p>
      <b>Conversion Rate</b>
      <p>The Conversion Rate is the amount of Common Energy that can be converted into Active Energy divided by the time. Trained wizards have a high Conversion Rate allowing them to use more powerful and potent spells since they can use more active energy without the need of building it up.</p>
      <b>Spells</b>
      <p>You can use Active Energy directly, or you can use active energy to code a spell and then use the spell. A spell is the coding of active energy. Here is an example. Imagine there is a soul with the Kinetic Affinity (moving stuff) this soul can directly use Active Energy to move a block, or the soul can code Active Energy with the instruction "move the block" and then shoot the spell to the block, and then the block will move.</p>
      <p>You could also create "if-then" statements in real life. For example you code a spell to "if block is touched, then move block". In "if-then" statements, the input and output of a spell have to be within the same affinity, otherwise the spell will be harder to do. For example a kinetic affinity soul will have trouble making the spell "if person thinks about trees, move block" here the kinetic affinity person will have trouble with the "if" part of the spell, meanwhile a psychological affinity person would have trouble with the "then" part of the statemant which is to move the block.</p>
      <p>Simple souls can do this too. For example the simple soul of creation could make the spell "if this is created, then create this". The Simple soul of relativity could do "if this spacetime is bent, then unbend it". Spells also consume Common Energy by themselves until the active energy runs out</p>
      <p>The only type of soul that will have a lot of trouble doing this is the simple soul of change</p>
      <b>Complexity/Randomness/Change</b>
      <p>After some strange event, the Complex Spell appeared. A powerful spell capable of changing the state of any type of energy into another purely at random. This spell began consuming the universe. This is why the universe created a simple soul that was capable of using the simple spell to handle the complexity spell. Somehow the complexity spell was dealt with.</p>
      <p>The Complex spell is one of the only things that can change a soul. You can also call this spell the spell of change since that is what it does to everything, it changes stuff. It is a very dangerous and cataclysmic spell.</p>
      <p>Now let's look at a Normal soul</p>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/soul1.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>We can now see a simplification of how a soul looks. The soul stuff can be moved and manipulated by the soul to convert Common Energy into Active Energy, let's move to the next type of soul The Soul stuff's characteristics are what defines the affinity of the soul.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/soul2.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>The simple soul. Similar to a normal soul except it ahs the simple spell. Also, the soul stuff has a more fundamental affinity than normal soul.</p>
      <p>Soul affected by the Complex Spell</p>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/changed.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>The complexity spell is shown by the random lines, this is a soul that has been completely consumed by complexity. In this case, you can say that the soul is more powerful since it doesn't need Common Energy to destroy stuff. Furthermore, the corrupted soul has control over the complexity's intensity which allows it to do something very interesting. It allows it to keep changing something until the desired outcome is true. This means that someone with a corrupted soul core is basically invencible. Imagine you shoot a person with this soul, this person is capable of using the complex spell infinitely until it effectively stops the bullet. I call this move "anything but death"</p>
      <p>There are obvious limitations to this, for example imagine someone dies, the probability of reviving someone through a change spell is too low to be considered possible. Furthermore, the probability of doing anything too specific is way too low, so corrupted souls are not gods. However the probablity of the simple spell creating something capable of blocking a bullet, stopping a train, or creating something that can cushion a fall is high in comparison.</p>
      <p>The random spells caused by the complexity tend to be really destructive, this might put the person with the corrupted soul in danger. However they can use the "anything but death" thing to survive anything. That is how these people are overpowered.</p>
      <p>Corrupted souls become more corrupted the more they use their powers. They also start losing their minds a little bit.</p>
      <p>The Simple Soul of change</p>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/change.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>The Simple Soul of change is the most original soul. It is a simple soul with the ability to control the complex spell, allowing it to control what is changed. The Complex spell in this soul is less intense than in the corrupted soul.</p>
      <p>This soul can do Random Spells aswell, however it can't do it at an intensity that allows it to do the "anything but death" move. So doing a completely random spell is not a good idea since it will most likely result in them dying. Instead the Simple Soul of Change should strive to control the complex spell in order to make more controled changes to the enviorment.</p>
      <p>Okay so now let's look at other interesting souls</p>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/curse.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>This soul has a curse, a curse is a spell placed in the soul stuff of a soul. In this case, this spell forcibly extracts more soul stuff out of the soul. The soul naturally has a minimum radius around it that has to be filled with soul stuff. If there is no soul stuff in this volume, the soul will create more soul stuff. However this spell consumes soul stuff whenever it is in need of energy. This means that if there is no common energy around, the spell will extract soul stuff out of the soul core and convert it into active energy. This is very painful, but its not physical pain, its spirtual pain. So it hurts much more.</p>
      <p>This spell makes the person immortal, the energy aquired is used to prevent the person's body from being broken. And in the extreme cases where it's somehow broken, the spell will use the energy to slowly regenerate the body. Very painful. This spell is too powerful and apprehensive to be taken out by a simple spell.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/tamper.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>These curses/blessings make the holder of this soul feel a strong innate desire or motivation to do something. So it might seem that these spells are benevolent. But they aren't, these goals can become obsessions. Curses like these can lead to obsession and insanity. Truth is that if a spell is affecting the soul core then it can't be good. You can only put a spell on the soul core on purpose and you can sometimes take it out with a simple spell.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>From all examples here, you might deduce that curses are always bad, but curses can also be blessings, as long as they are not affecting the SOUL CORE, it's better to leave the SOUL CORE alone. But when a curse is applied only within the SOUL STUFF, there can be benefits, and when a Curse benefits you, it's called a blessing.</p>
      <img src="img/lore/explain/memory.png" height="40%"width="40%">
      <p>This spell allows for the storing of information in a soul. This would allow someone to remember what their soul has been through in previous lifetimes.</p>
      <p>But this soul needs energy to be sustained since it can't grab energy from the soul core. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>MAGIC STONES</b>
      <p>They are a source of Common Energy, the most powerful source. Their origin is unkown.</p>
      <p>Every soul is different</p>
      <p>And one final very specific but important detail. If a magic stone makes contact with the complex spell, the complex spell will create many huge cataclysmic random spells and the stone will be destroyed. I am talking full on cataclysmic explotions. Also the common energy in all the universe will be amplified.</p>
