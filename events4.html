            <p>A break from the IB where everyone gets to do stuff.</p>
            <p>There were many concerts during these vacations, Marina, Valeria, and even <a href="others.html#lia">Lia</a> came to Uruguay at some point to visit their friends and be at the concerts. I didn't make any mention of concerts or anything because I wasn't there because I hate concerts.</p>
            <p>Just know that at most times, it is highly likely that anyone is at a concert. Specially ever since 28/12/2022.</p>
            <p>Also many of these events are known only because of social media posts, so some of them are not going to be detailed at all.</p>
            <p>Eitoku and Martina go to Japan and spend lots of time together.</p>

After a while Bruno leaves and Timo joins, this is when Mati finds himself in the deep dark, Timo and San follow him, Timo warns them not to make sound to avoid having to deal with the warden, but innevitably it gets summoned and it kills everyone.

                    <p>Timo, Eitoku, Fede, and Ethan go to the beach, they talk about grades. Eitoku and Ethan went to the sea while the rest stayed in the sand. After that they talked about musicals, spcifically Heathers. They decided to walk from the beach to a Cafe near Alex's house. They went there and they ate something. They talked about the questions that where asked at Chiara's house.</p>
                    <p>Lupi had asked Fede if he was gay, and Fede said yes. And then many other people asked him an he said yes so he assumes the entire class knows. Timo brought up Dani's question, and how his answer was kind of strange. Then they left</p>
                    <p>Later that day, Alex added Lucas to the WWC groupchat, they had a debate over songs and wheather or not they should change the name of the group, the group kept it's name.</p>
                    <p>Then Lucas and Timo played minecraft, they tried finishing the contamination factory that Timo had built, but then a guy joined the server and started wrecking havoc, but Timo dealt with him.</p>
                    <p>Then Dani and Timo talked about how it was wrong for society to believe that it was wrong for a person to have more friends of the opposite gender. However Dani believes that this is just the way things are and not much can be changed, while Timo believes that you can go against society and be friends of whoever you want to be friends with. Then they talked about everyone has moments where they act more like themselves than usual. For example Dani has a lot of Dani moments.</p>

                  <p>Lucas invited the WWC to his house. Timo is the first to arrive he gave Lucas a <a href="events.html#clovers">clover</a> that he found on his way there. Unfortunately the clover got immediately destroyed accidentally but it was good while it lasted. they play passes with a football until Ethan and Fede arrive, theny they continue playing passes together until Eitoku arrives.</p>
                  <p>Then they all sit down and talk about different things. Like Fede's and Lucas' new phones, and Fede played pokemon violet, which has a really long introduction and one of the characters looks like <a href="others.html#nata">Natasia Bethe</a> which he does not like, Timo inquires why Fede does not like her, but he doesn't offer a straight answer. A long time ago, <a href="events.html#fedebirth">Nata wasn't invited to Fede's birthday party</a>, but they didn't like each other that much before this either. However Timo assumed that it was because of the birthday stuff. </p>
                  <p>Then everyone orders food from McDonalds, Eitoku, Lucas, and Fede go to the pool, Ethan joins them but not before giving his phone to Timo, so that he could check the information about the order.</p>
                  <p>Everyone gets out of the pool and then the food arrives, everyone eats while Timo and Ethan play a game of chess,  Ethan completely forgot how to play, then Eitoku played Timo.</p>
                  <p>After that all of them play UNO, and Eitoku wins 4 times in a row. Then they go upstairs and play ping pong. Everyone goes down except Timo who is teaching Ethan how to play ping pong. While the rest go to the pool again.</p>
                  <p>Ethan improved a lot in ping pong, he plays against everyone, he still loses, but he plays better now. Then everyone leaves.</p>

                <b>Team 1</b>

                  <li>Timo</li>
                  <li><a href="others.html#fedeber">Federico Berman</a> </li>
                  <li>Milagros (A friend Nata knows, not milagros from the class)</li>
                  <li>Another girl whose name I forgot... sorry</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Team 2</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Nata</li>
                  <li>Lara</li>
                  <li>Tai</li>
                  <li>Mr Berman (Lara and Fede's dad)</li>
                  <li>A kid</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Round 1 - Get to the enemy base</b>
                <p>A member of a team has to get to the opposing team's base. Both teams spend their time behind obstacles stalling waiting for the others to make a mistake until Timo gets bored and risks himself to try to get Mr Berman, however he fails and gets shot in the head. The round ends after that.</p>
                <b>Round 2 - Get to the enemy base</b>
                <p>In the second round, Timo covers a lot of ground quickly and shoots Tai down, he then goes into a room where he finds Mr Berman both agreed not to shoot eachother and go back to their bases to revive, however there was a misunderstanding, Mr Berman did not go back to his base while Timo did, so Timo came back to the same room to find Mr Berman still there. This counted as 2 kills for the other team. Meanwhile Nata was shooting down the rest of the team with incredible skill the round ends and Mr Berman acknowledgedes Timo's bravery to cover a large amount of ground so quickly, yet questions why he entered the same room he was in twice. Timo explains he thought that both had been eliminated.</p>
                <b>Round 1 - Raid</b>
                <p>One team has the highground and only one life, the other team has to get to their base in time. Timo's team is the team with only one life. They played well and defensively, they were going to win, until Nata sneaked her way through the stairs with a shield, Milagros saw her but she did not want to shoot because she was too close and Milagros did not want to hurt Nata. So Nata's team wins. However because of Milagros' mercy, Timo considers this a win since they would have won if it wasn't for Milagros' mercy.</p>
                <b>Round 1 - Raid</b>
                <p>The team pushes forward, but they get stuck in  the stairs, the stairs are too open, and the shield can't cover them enouph. Timo attempts to go up but finds it problematic because Lara is raining bullets directly above him, he retreats tactically through a window with the shield, he tells Milagros to take care of Lara while he goes up. Milagros does not do that, she instead charges with the shield above, but the shield can only shield 1.7 people, so Nata was capable of sneakily shooting Timo and then the match ended.</p>
                <p>Nata gained the title of <b>Marksman</b> for aiming so well.</p>
                <p>Timo was awarded the title of <b>Bravery</b> for daring to push forward even when the odds where not in his favour.</p>

                <b>31/12/2022 - 01/01/2023</b>
                <h2>NEW YEAR</h2>
                <p>It is a new year, today Sofe went to Rome with his boyfriend, <a href="others.html#juampi">Juampi</a>.</p>
                <p>Fireworks are fired, resolutions are said. Martina and Eitoku are in Dubai, Sofe and Juampi are travelling to rome.</p>
                <p>After the new year, Dani and Timo talk about many topics, from the prime minister of Lizz Truz to predictions for the future quarter, sleep paralysis, dreams about Turner, and many other things. They first talk about new years resolution, Timo says he that he is going to start trying in school and in life in general, while Dani will keep things as they are. He will just expand upon himself.</p>
                <p>Dani eventually asks Timo to tell him about Eitoku, Timo tells him that Eitoku is really nice but Eitoku thinks that Dani might be racist, Dani asks why, and Timo responds that it's probably because of things Eitoku has heard about Dani. Dani said that it was probably Martina telling bad things about Dani to Eitoku. Timo said that Ethan also didn't like Dani and Ethan often speaks with Eitoku </p>
                <p>Ethan doesn't like Dani ever since <a href="events3.html#ethanhate">Foege's presentation</a> where Dani did absolutely nothing to contribute. But Ethan also doesn't like some of the sexist jokes or comments that Dani does. Dani is well aware that Ethan dislikes him, however he finds it kind of dumb that he still holds on to that one time in history class. He says that the best course of action is to "let it be" arguing that he can't be liked by everyone.</p>          
                <p>Timo thinks that this problem needs a solution, while Dani believes that they should just let it be. The conversation deviated to Dani claiming that Anime portrays Japan as being better than what it actually is, even though Dani never went to Japan. Then Dani talks about bias is created by prejudices, he used Fede as the target example, him being gay affects everyone's views on him, when he is actually just a normal person.</p>

                <p>Then, Dani and Timo talk about <a href="events3.html#dani!?">Dani's Camp Question</a> to the girls. Timo told him that when he told Sofe what Dani had asked, Sofe immediately gave an answer, but Timo didn't remember it. Dani wanted to know, so he asked Timo to ask Sofe the answer to that question. Timo refused.</p>
                <p>Also, Dani said that there were actually 2 reasons for asking the question, the first one was revealed in Chiara's hangout, but the second one was that he said he would find it funny, and he likes building his personality of someone who "doesn't give a shit" about what other people think of him. So aksing that question demonstrates that he doesn't care what others think of him.</p>

                <h2>Walking Time</h2>
                <p>Timo walked from arocena to Fede's house, then they went to a nearby park to meat up with Sebas, but they did not find him. So they meandered around trying to find him, until they went back to Fede's house, and Sebas was there. They then went to the park.</p>
                <p>In the park, they do some showing and telling. Sebas tells about how he went to Argentina, and Punta Del Este, and other places and he showed some invisible shoes. Timo tells about how he played paintball and went to Punta Del Este, Fede tells about how he went to Punta Del Este and read 50 books. Then They talk about Dani, Dani is always an interesting topic to talk about.</p>
                <p>After that they decide to walk all the way to Sebas' house, so they go to Fede's house, drink water, and they start their journey to Sebas' house. Sebs' house is really far by the way. They were walking by the beach when a woman stopped at Fede's house and she starts following them, but they eventually lost the woman. Timo grabs a random lighter that he found in a bench, Sebas asks him if he would take anything he saw, and Timo said "finders keepers" Sebas reflects, saying he has to be careful around Timo. Fede and Sebas then talk about random things all the way, the walk is very long.</p>
                <p>Eventually they reach Sebas' house, they are completely exhausted from the very long walk so they chill there for some time, and they get to meet Sebas' brother, <a href="others.html#esteban">Esteban</a>

                </div>
                <p id="fanta">After that, they decided to go to the park, and also buy something to eat. So they walked there, past some tennis courts, and went to a small shop where Fede bought some organic chips, Sebas bought a Misterio Flavoured fanta, and timo bought some coated nuts. They went to the park and ate them while listening to music from Fede's little speaker that he got for christmas. They talk about rumours, one of them is that Nikki had unprotected sex with someone, they then talk about the origin and the cause of rumours, and about their credibility, and then about Fede's camping trip. They also start planning what to do for dinner, they decide they are going to go to a good place that Sebas' knows is near his house.</p>
                <p>They start their walk to Sebas's house, and they discuss how Ethan could possibly hate Dani. They talk about how Dani is not hateable, if anything he is pitiable.</p>
                <p>They get to Sebas' and they play a game called "Stalin o Caldera", a game where you try to guess The Object in someone's head by choosing an object, comparing it with a previous object, and seeing if it is more similar to The Object than the previous object. The 2 initial objects are Stalin o Caldera.</p>
                <p>Timo chose sword as his object, sebas and fede went through this path.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Caldera</li>
                  <li>Metal</li>
                  <li>Spoon</li>
                  <li>Fan</li>
                  <li>Helicopter</li>
                  <li>Attack Helicopter</li>
                  <li><p>Timo sees that Sebas and Fede aren't getting anywhere, so he tells them about the movie that they previously whatched together(Bullet Train, which had swords) and also to thing of what helicopters and fans have in common, after that the answer was obvious.</p></li>
                  <li><b>Swords</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p id="oliva">Then, Timo opens a drawer and finds a bracelet that Sebas had been searching for. The group then decides to leave to go to eat. They go to the restaurant that Sebas proposed, but its closed, so they start to head to another restaurant with milanesas that they found through google maps. They stumble unto a small pizza restaurant called "Oliva"</p>

                <p>They go to a park to eat the pizzas, a homeless man approaches them and asks for a lighter, Timo left the black lighter he found at Sebas' home. Then Sebas says that maybe the black lighter belonged to the homeless man and Timo stole it from him. The man was kind, and he was surprised that everyone spoke english. Timo went to get some napkins, they gave him some paper instead.</p>
                <p>Fede remarked how he was not going to tell his mother that they did this because it was unsafe, Sebas countered, saying that there was a police station "a stone-throw away". After finishing the pizza, they talked about coolness.</p>
                <p>Sebas had a friend whom he slept in a bench with, that same friend also did drugs, he said he was the most cool friend. Fede also asked Sebas to rank him in a scale from uncool to LitLeo. Sebas chose Bottom G.</p>
                <p>Finally, they planned to prank Esteban and make him say "Under where?"(underwear) by asking him "What's under there?" But they never got to do it because Timo had to leave, and Fede left with him.</p>

                <p>Sebas, Fede, and Ethan are invited by Timo to stay at a hostel in Jose Ignacio called "Wanderlust".</p>
                <p>They met up at Obra in arocena and then went to a place called Otero, and then went in Timo's father's car to Jose Ignacio, they listened to songs and played many games in their phones. One of those games was Dragon City</p>
                <p>Once they got to the Hostel, they settled down, and rested for a bit of time, they checked out the room which had an air conditioner and according to fede, it had good water pressure. After that they decided to go eat something, so they walked all the way to the main Jose Ignacio town. On the way there, they talked about many things, they also pointed out a terrible building.</p>
                <p>When they got to a restaurant, Timo realised that he forgot his wallet, so he had to run all the way back to the hotel to get it back, he got really tired after that. Timo arrived just in time for the food, they ate their food. Timo then remembered he had little to no money on the debit card so he might have walked all the way back for nothing. When the waiter asked Timo if he would tip, Timo said no since he didn't know if that would be enouph, Sebas was shocked since he never saw anyone not giving a tip, Timo's card didn't have anything so Fede payed for him. Timo stole a alchohol spray bottle, and Sebas and Fede reflected on how Timo always steals things.</p>
                <p>They go to get ice-cream at nearby freddo, but the ice-cream is too expensive, so they instead get cheap ice-cream from the gas station, except Timo who didn't have money. They went back to the Hostel, taking a shortcut that Timo suggested, which ended up being longer than their original path.</p>

Everyone was wondering what the secret was. Fede theorised that it was Victoria's secret. When they got to the end of the path, they arrived onto a normal beach, leaving them wandering what the secret was.</p>
                <p>Ethan and Sebas went to swim in the sea while Fede taught Timo how to play Truco. Timo almost won by getting lucky, but Fede caught up to him. When Sebas and Ethan got back from swimming, they all played whitejack where 3 rules got added.</p>
                <b>All the whitejack rules</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you have the joker card, you can add a rule</li>

                  <li>The round goes counterclockwise</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After that game, they went back to the Wanderlust, where they ate chips called Ruffles and also some apples. Timo wanted to play Spaceteam, a game where two or more people have to cooperate to keep a spaceship up and running. But Sebas wanted to play Among Us, a game where people have to keep a spaceship running but there is also an impostor murderer that crewmates need to vote out. Fede and Timo first played spaceteam, and then everyone except Ethan played among us. While playing among us, they encounteres a British boy that Fede and Sebas made fun of, and the Brit got really angry and started insulting them. Sebas wanted his instagram so that he could call the brit a gypsy. The game quickly turned into Sebas and Fede trying to get the boys instagram while Timo tried solving the mystery.</p>
                <p>At the end, the impostor was found, and the Brit said he would send his discord to them, however he never did.</p>
                <p>After that, they went all the way to La Barra so that they could eat something. The group walked and talked about Dani, where Timo tried to convince Ethan that Dani wasn't bad, but Ethan wouldn't disagreed. They ended up going to a restaurant that had a violinist that played several known songs, the violinist was really good. After they ordered the food, a the violinist left, and a guy with a Didgeridoo came and started playing a cool combination of beatboxing and Didgeridoo playing. Fede wrote a definition in one of <a href="events3.html#journals">Timo's journals</a> </p>

                    <h2>Wanderlust 2</h2>
                    <p>They all wake up and Fede has the terrible idea to play Monopoly. Pauli (Timo's sister) starts winning by a lot, and Timo declares that his objective is to get all train stations. But Ethan gets one Train before Timo. Fede states that people are allowed to make deals in this game, and so Timo makes a deall with Ethan 1002 dollars for the train station, Ethan accepts but Timo isn't happy about paying that much. Ethan also interrupted everyone's progress at different points throughout the game so everyone ganged up on him to beat him. However before the game could finish, they all got too hungry to continue so they went to eat. The game lasted 3 hours.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Then they went to eat to a restaurant called "Shelter". Once the food arrived, Ethan quickly realised that his Milanesa was pork and not beef, Ethan is a jew by the way. So the waiter apologised and they brought Ethan a chivito, the Chivito had bacon in it. So the waiter apologised once again and they brought Ethan a brand new Chivito, with ham. After that, the waiter apologised one final time before serving Ethan a 100% pork free Chivito.</p>
                    <p>After that they went to the beach, where Sebas and Ethan built a massive hole and went to the beach, meanwhile Fede and Timo chilled.</p>
