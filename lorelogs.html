        <li>
          <p><b>New info:</b> The CCC picks up the magical signal of the huge explotion. However they believe that the origin of this explotion is from a signal sent by a meteor composed of Magic Stones. One scientist called Ava Reyes discovers that this might not be the case, her team goes to to Uruguay to investigate.<p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Update:</b>All attempts to execute any member of the table tube gang have failed.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Alex:</b>Agent 1 spotted Alex. He told Alex that he was under arest, but Alex refused to come with the Agent. The Agent pointed his gun at Alex, and threatened him, Alex grabbed a weird object and took a defensive stance. The agent shot Alex, however Alex used the object which ressembled a ping pong paddle but composed of an unkown, highly resistant metal, and hit the bullet back towards the Agent, after that Alex was aware of the CCC, so he used his quick thinking to get away before anyone had a chance to get close to him.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Milla:</b>Agent 12 saw Milla in a forest, but before he was able to approach her, Milla turned the agent into a fish, other agents no longer dare to approach Milla.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Megan:</b>Agent 35 and 39 saw Megan and shot her. She turned into a horse and stomped both of them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Fede:</b>Agent 31, Agent 25, agen 19, Agent 30, and Agent 22 worked together to locate Fede, it seemed that fede was aware of the CCC trying to capture the TTG, and he left clues that would supposedly lead the CCC to his whereabouts. At first the team suspected it was a trap, but they still decided to follow the clues. The clues lead them to a warehouse in a forest, as soon as everyone entered, the floor beneath them collapsed and all the agents all fell in a trap, Fede then informed them that if they didn't reaveal classified information he would release chlorine gas and kill them all. All agents stayed loyal to the agency and did not say anything. Fede did not release chlorine, he released a colorless liquid through some tubes in the walls. The liquid was was described smelling pleasently sweet, all agents escaped the place after 6 hours. Chemical examinations show that the gas was tetraethyl lead, and extremely toxic gas that causes long term organ failures. All agents exposed to the gas have suffered from severe lead poisoning, making them unable to do their job. The CCC ordered all agents to abandon the chase for Fede.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Sebas:</b>Agent 3, Agent 7, and Agent 14 Found Sebas drinking a purple substance from a bucket in the street. All agents shot Sebas who showed signs of extreme pain, but no physical harm. The agents surrounded Sebas and where about to grab him, but Sebas suddenly splashed the guards with the purple liquid. Chemical examinations show that the liquid was a mixture of vodka, high concentration tetraethyl lead, high concentration hydrofluoric acid, benadryl, cough syrup, and red grape wine. He called this strange concoction "Table Tube Gang's limited edition Lean". It goes without saying that the agents where completely incapacitated after the incident.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Timo:</b> Agent 13 was walking in the pavement when he tripped and fell on the street, his gun fell close to a street drain, Timo appeared and offered help, Agent 13 immediately reached for his gun, but a bystander unkowingly kicked it to a street drain. The irritated agent grabbed Timo with force and took him to his a van. Three tires went flat, and the Agent crashed as a result. Agent 13 went to check on Timo, but he was no longer there.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Megan and Milla leave:</b> Since the CCC failed to capture or terminate the TTG members, the CCC pulled some strings to send Milla and Megan to different countries, the CCC hopes this will lessen the odds of significant change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The group known as the Table Tube Gang seems to be gone, however another group has formed, they call themselves, the Wander Warblers Contingent. CCC is currently analysing potential threats.</p>
