      <p>All right, I made this website but it is really rudimentary. So, this is how it works. If you hover your cursor on the top of the page you will be presented with a control pad. This will be what you will use to go to the different pages. The main page is <b>Events</b>, the other pages are really unnecesary and you probably never need to got there. Here are all the pages</p>
      <div style="background-color:rgb(115, 135, 118); border:3px solid black; padding:10px;">
        <ul>
          <h3>Guide</h3>
          <li>hate.html is the first page I made when I was bored in history class. I class that I hated. I just write random stuff here when I am bored.</li>
          <li>gallery.html is actually pretty cool. I was going to put every picture there but I realised that there are a lot of pictures, so I only put some pictures.</li>
          <li>quotes.html is for writing the things that have been said which are worth remembering.</li>
          <li>groups.html is for writing all the different groups that exist which I know of. Sometimes specific groups of people hang out often, so i will very likely refer to a group of people as a random name.</li>
          <li>others.html is for a short description of every person in the events page, if you somehow appear on the events page but not in the others page, then congratulations... you are irrelevant.</li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <b><p style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: none; color: black;"><a href="events.html">events.html</a></p></b>
            <p>And finally there is the events page. It's a timeline or a chronicle that started during the quarintines and went all the way to the graduation of the class of 2024.</p>
            <p>You might notice that the control pad has an additional square in the control pad. If you hover over this square you will see all of the chapters in the events section.</p>
